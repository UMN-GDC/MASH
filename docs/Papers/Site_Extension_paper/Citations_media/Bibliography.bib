The variety of human neuroscience concepts and terminology poses a fundamental challenge to relating brain imaging results across the scientific literature. Existing meta-analysis methods perform statistical tests on sets of publications associated with a particular concept. Thus, large-scale meta-analyses only tackle single terms that occur frequently. We propose a new paradigm, focusing on prediction rather than inference. Our multivariate model predicts the spatial distribution of neurological observations, given text describing an experiment, cognitive process, or disease. This approach handles text of arbitrary length and terms that are too rare for standard meta-analysis. We capture the relationships and neural correlates of 7547 neuroscience terms across 13 459 neuroimaging publications.

	abstract = {Background: Multi-site functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) databases are becoming increasingly prevalent in the study of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. However, multi-site databases are known to introduce site effects that may confound neurobiological and measures such as functional connectivity ({FC}). Although studies have been conducted to mitigate site effects, these methods often result in reduced effect size in {FC} comparisons between controls and patients.Methods: We present a site-wise de-meaning ({SWD}) strategy in multi-site {FC} analysis and compare its performance with two common site-effect mitigation methods, i.e., generalized linear model ({GLM}) and Combining Batches ({ComBat}) Harmonization. For {SWD}, after {FC} was calculated and Fisher z-transformed, the site-wise {FC} mean was removed from each subject before group-level statistical analysis. The above methods were tested on two multi-site psychiatric consortiums [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ({ABIDE}) and Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-{SNIP})]. Preservation of consistent {FC} alterations in patients were evaluated for each method through the effect sizes (Hedge’s g) of patients vs. controls.Results: For the B-{SNIP} dataset, {SWD} improved the effect size between schizophrenic and control subjects by 4.5–7.9\%, while {GLM} and {ComBat} decreased the effect size by 22.5–42.6\%. For the {ABIDE} dataset, {SWD} improved the effect size between autistic and control subjects by 2.9–5.3\%, while {GLM} and {ComBat} decreased the effect size by up to 11.4\%.Conclusion: Compared to the original data and commonly used methods, the {SWD} method demonstrated superior performance in preserving the effect size in {FC} features associated with disorders.},

	abstract = {When collecting large amounts of neuroimaging data associated with psychiatric disorders, images must be acquired from multiple sites because of the limited capacity of a single site. However, site differences represent a barrier when acquiring multisite neuroimaging data. We utilized a traveling-subject dataset in conjunction with a multisite, multidisorder dataset to demonstrate that site differences are composed of biological sampling bias and engineering measurement bias. The effects on resting-state functional {MRI} connectivity based on pairwise correlations because of both bias types were greater than or equal to psychiatric disorder differences. Furthermore, our findings indicated that each site can sample only from a subpopulation of participants. This result suggests that it is essential to collect large amounts of neuroimaging data from as many sites as possible to appropriately estimate the distribution of the grand population. Finally, we developed a novel harmonization method that removed only the measurement bias by using a traveling-subject dataset and achieved the reduction of the measurement bias by 29\% and improvement of the signal-to-noise ratios by 40\%. Our results provide fundamental knowledge regarding site effects, which is important for future research using multisite, multidisorder resting-state functional {MRI} data.},

	abstract = {When training predictive models from neuroimaging data, we typically have available non-imaging variables such as age and gender that affect the imaging data but which we may be uninterested in from a clinical perspective. Such variables are commonly referred to as 'confounds'. In this work, we firstly give a working definition for confound in the context of training predictive models from samples of neuroimaging data. We define a confound as a variable which affects the imaging data and has an association with the target variable in the sample that differs from that in the population-of-interest, i.e., the population over which we intend to apply the estimated predictive model. The focus of this paper is the scenario in which the confound and target variable are independent in the population-of-interest, but the training sample is biased due to a sample association between the target and confound. We then discuss standard approaches for dealing with confounds in predictive modelling such as image adjustment and including the confound as a predictor, before deriving and motivating an Instance Weighting scheme that attempts to account for confounds by focusing model training so that it is optimal for the population-of-interest. We evaluate the standard approaches and Instance Weighting in two regression problems with neuroimaging data in which we train models in the presence of confounding, and predict samples that are representative of the population-of-interest. For comparison, these models are also evaluated when there is no confounding present. In the first experiment we predict the {MMSE} score using structural {MRI} from the {ADNI} database with gender as the confound, while in the second we predict age using structural {MRI} from the {IXI} database with acquisition site as the confound. Considered over both datasets we find that none of the methods for dealing with confounding gives more accurate predictions than a baseline model which ignores confounding, although including the confound as a predictor gives models that are less accurate than the baseline model. We do find, however, that different methods appear to focus their predictions on specific subsets of the population-of-interest, and that predictive accuracy is greater when there is no confounding present. We conclude with a discussion comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and the implications of our evaluation for building predictive models that can be used in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Acquiring resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) datasets at multiple {MRI} scanners and clinical sites can improve statistical power and generalizability of results. However, multi‐site neuroimaging studies have reported considerable nonbiological variability in {fMRI} measurements due to different scanner manufacturers and acquisition protocols. These undesirable sources of variability may limit power to detect effects of interest and may even result in erroneous findings. Until now, there has not been an approach that removes unwanted site effects. In this study, using a relatively large multi‐site (4 sites) {fMRI} dataset, we investigated the impact of site effects on functional connectivity and network measures estimated by widely used connectivity metrics and brain parcellations. The protocols and image acquisition of the dataset used in this study had been homogenized using identical {MRI} phantom acquisitions from each of the neuroimaging sites; however, intersite acquisition effects were not completely eliminated. Indeed, in this study, we found that the magnitude of site effects depended on the choice of connectivity metric and brain atlas. Therefore, to further remove site effects, we applied {ComBat}, a harmonization technique previously shown to eliminate site effects in multi‐site diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) and cortical thickness studies. In the current work, {ComBat} successfully removed site effects identified in connectivity and network measures and increased the power to detect age associations when using optimal combinations of connectivity metrics and brain atlases. Our proposed {ComBat} harmonization approach for {fMRI}‐derived connectivity measures facilitates reliable and efficient analysis of retrospective and prospective multi‐site {fMRI} neuroimaging studies.},

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, {DTI} images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy ({FA}) and mean diffusivity ({MD}) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the {DTI} measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining {DTI} data from multiple sites, without harmonization, may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for {DTI} data, and show that {ComBat}, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in {FA} and {MD} maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that {ComBat} both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.},

	abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

	abstract = {A common limitation of neuroimaging studies is their small sample sizes. To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis ({ENIGMA}) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and sequences. {ENIGMA} projects commonly address this heterogeneity with random-effects meta-analysis or mixed-effects mega-analysis. Here we tested whether the batch adjustment method, {ComBat}, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and {ComBat} mega-analyses to compare cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of {ComBat} substantially increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to random-effects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing {ComBat} with mixed-effects mega-analysis, although {ComBat} still slightly increased the statistical significance. {ComBat} also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we applied the {ComBat} harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the {ComBat} function to attenuate potential effects of site in {ENIGMA} projects and other multi-site structural imaging work. We provide easy-to-use functions in R that work even if imaging data are partially missing in some brain regions, and they can be trained with one data set and then applied to another (a requirement for some analyses such as machine learning).},
