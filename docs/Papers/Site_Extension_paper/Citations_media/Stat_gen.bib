	abstract = {Multivariate analysis using mixed models allows for the exploration of genetic correlations between traits. Additionally, the transition to a genomic based approach is simplified by substituting classic pedigrees with a marker-based relationship matrix. It also enables the investigation of correlated responses to selection, trait integration and modularity in different kinds of populations. This study investigated a strategy for the construction of a marker-based relationship matrix that prioritized markers using Partial Least Squares. The efficiency of this strategy was found to depend on the correlation structure between investigated traits. In terms of accuracy, we found no benefit of this strategy compared with the all-marker-based multivariate model for the primary trait of diameter at breast height ({DBH}) in a radiata pine (Pinus radiata) population, possibly due to the presence of strong and well-estimated correlation with other highly heritable traits. Conversely, we did see benefit in a shining gum (Eucalyptus nitens) population, where the primary trait had low or only moderate genetic correlation with other low/moderately heritable traits. Marker selection in multivariate analysis can therefore be an efficient strategy to improve prediction accuracy for low heritability traits due to improved precision in poorly estimated low/moderate genetic correlations. Additionally, our study identified the genetic diversity as a factor contributing to the efficiency of marker selection in multivariate approaches due to higher precision of genetic correlation estimates.},

	abstract = {For a family-based sample, the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix can be parameterized to include the variance of a polygenic effect that has then been estimated using a variance component analysis. However, with the advent of large-scale genomic data, the genetic relationship matrix ({GRM}) can be estimated and can be utilized to parameterize the variance of a polygenic effect for population-based samples. Therefore narrow sense heritability, which is both population and trait specific, can be estimated with both population- and family-based samples. In this study we estimate heritability from both family-based and population-based samples, collected in Korea, and the heritability estimates from the pooled samples were, for height, 0.60; body mass index ({BMI}), 0.32; log-transformed triglycerides (log {TG}), 0.24; total cholesterol ({TCHL}), 0.30; high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}), 0.38; low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), 0.29; systolic blood pressure ({SBP}), 0.23; and diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}), 0.24. Furthermore, we found differences in how heritability is estimated - in particular the amount of variance attributable to common environment in twins can be substantial - which indicates heritability estimates should be interpreted with caution.},

With next generation sequencing technologies it is possible to obtain genetic data for all accessible genetic variations in the genome.

This article presents a new method for inferring an individual’s ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in next generation sequencing data into account. This is achieved by working directly with genotype likelihoods that contain all relevant information of the unobserved genotypes. Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very low-depth data.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) for complex diseases often collect data on multiple correlated endo-phenotypes. Multivariate analysis of these correlated phenotypes can improve the power to detect genetic variants. Multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA}) can perform such association analysis at a {GWAS} level, but the behavior of {MANOVA} under different trait models has not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we show that {MANOVA} is generally very powerful for detecting association but there are situations, such as when a genetic variant is associated with all the traits, where {MANOVA} may not have any detection power. In these situations, marginal model based methods, however, perform much better than multivariate methods. We investigate the behavior of {MANOVA}, both theoretically and using simulations, and derive the conditions where {MANOVA} loses power. Based on our findings, we propose a unified score-based test statistic {USAT} that can perform better than {MANOVA} in such situations and nearly as well as {MANOVA} elsewhere. Our proposed test reports an approximate asymptotic P-value for association and is computationally very efficient to implement at a {GWAS} level. We have studied through extensive simulations the performance of {USAT}, {MANOVA}, and other existing approaches and demonstrated the advantage of using the {USAT} approach to detect association between a genetic variant and multivariate phenotypes. We applied {USAT} to data from three correlated traits collected on 5, 816 Caucasian individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ({ARIC}, The {ARIC} Investigators [1989]) Study and detected some interesting associations.},

	abstract = {Motivation Genome-wide association studies are now shifting focus from analysis of common to rare variants. As power for association testing for individual rare variants may often be low, various aggregate level association tests have been proposed to detect genetic loci. Typically, power calculations for such tests require specification of large number of parameters, including effect sizes and allele frequencies of individual variants, making them difficult to use in practice. We propose to approximate power to a varying degree of accuracy using a smaller number of key parameters, including the total genetic variance explained by multiple variants within a locus. Results We perform extensive simulation studies to assess the accuracy of the proposed approximations in realistic settings. Using these simplified power calculations, we develop an analytic framework to obtain bounds on genetic architecture of an underlying trait given results from genome-wide association studies with rare variants. Finally, we provide insights into the required quality of annotation/functional information for identification of likely causal variants to make meaningful improvement in power.

	abstract = {The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ({TOPMed}) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the {TOPMed} goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through {dbGaP} (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) 1. In the first 53,831 {TOPMed} samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in {TOPMed} studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining {TOPMed} haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01\%. Advancing {DNA}-sequencing technologies and decreasing costs are enabling researchers to explore human genetic variation at an unprecedented scale 2,3. For these advances to improve our understanding of human health, they must be deployed in well-phenotyped human samples and used to build resources such as variation catalogues 3,4 , control collections 5,6 and imputation reference panels 7-9. Here we describe high-coverage whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) analyses of the first 53,831 {TOPMed} samples (Box 1 and Extended Data Tables 1, 2); additional data are being made available as quality control, variant calling and {dbGaP} curation are completed (altogether more than 130,000 {TOPMed} samples are now available in {dbGaP}). A key goal of the {TOPMed} programme is to understand risk factors for heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders by adding {WGS} and other 'omics' data to existing studies with deep phenotyping (Supplementary Information 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The programme currently consists of more than 80 participating studies, around 1,000 investigators and more than 30 working groups (https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/ working-groups-public). {TOPMed} participants are ethnically and ancestrally diverse (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 1.1.4 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Through a combination of race and ethnicity information (from participant questionnaires and/or study inclusion criteria), we classified study participants into 'population groups', which varied in composition according to the goals of each analysis. In some analyses, these groups were further refined using genetic ancestry (see Methods and Supplementary Information for details). Our study extends previous efforts by identifying and characterizing the rare variants that comprise the majority of human genomic variation 7,10-12. Rare variants represent recent and potentially deleteri-ous changes that can affect protein function, gene expression or other biologically important elements 11,13,14. {TOPMed} {WGS} quality assessment {WGS} of the {TOPMed} samples was performed over multiple studies, years and sequencing centres. To minimize batch effects, we standardized laboratory methods, mapped and processed sequence data centrally using a single pipeline, and performed variant calling and genotyping jointly across all samples (see Methods). We annotated each variant site with multiple sequence quality metrics and trained machine learning filters to identify and exclude inconsistencies that are revealed when the same individual was sequenced repeatedly. Available {WGS} data were processed periodically to produce genotype data 'freezes'. The 53,831 samples described here are drawn from {TOPMed} freeze 5. Stringent variant and sample quality filters were applied and the resulting genotype call sets were evaluated in several ways (Supple-mentary Information 1.2.2, 1.3, 1.4). First, we compared genotypes for samples sequenced in duplicate (the mean alternative allele concordance was 0.9995 for single-nucleotide variants ({SNVs}) and 0.9930 for insertions or deletions (indels)). Second, we compared genotypes to those from previous whole-exome sequencing datasets (protein-coding regions from {GENCODE} 15 ; 80\% of variants were found with both approaches and overlapping variant calls had a concordance of 0.9993 for {SNVs} and 0.9974 for indels) (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Third, we compared genotypes to those obtained using alternative https://doi.},

	abstract = {Complex inherited phenotypes, including those for many common medical and psychiatric diseases, are most likely underpinned by multiple genes contributing to interlocking molecular biological processes, along with environmental factors (Owen et al., 2010). Despite this, genotyping strategies for complex, inherited, disease-related phenotypes mostly employ univariate analyses, e.g., genome wide association. Such procedures most often identify isolated risk-related {SNPs} or loci, not the underlying biological pathways necessary to help guide the development of novel treatment approaches. This article focuses on the multivariate analysis strategy of parallel (i.e., simultaneous combination of {SNP} and neuroimage information) independent component analysis (p-{ICA}), which typically yields large clusters of functionally related {SNPs} statistically correlated with phenotype components, whose overall molecular biologic relevance is inferred subsequently using annotation software suites. Because this is a novel approach, whose details are relatively new to the field we summarize its underlying principles and address conceptual questions regarding interpretation of resulting data and provide practical illustrations of the method.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) continues to drive many important neuroscientific advances. However, progress in uncovering reproducible associations between individual differences in brain structure/function and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25)[1][1],[2][2]. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ({ABCD}) Study[3][3] (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain-wide associations studies ({BWAS}) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain-wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller samples, typical for brain-wide association studies ({BWAS}), irreproducible, inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate, multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium-levels, {BWAS} were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors contribute to replication failures[4][4]–[6][5]; here, we show that the pairing of small brain-behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is a key element in wide-spread {BWAS} replication failure. Brain-behavioral phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample sizes of N⪆2,000. While investigator-initiated brain-behavior research continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible human brain-wide association studies.

	abstract = {Animal data show that cortical development is initially patterned by genetic gradients largely along three orthogonal axes. We previously reported differences in genetic influences on cortical surface area along an anterior-posterior axis using neuroimaging data of adult human twins. Here, we demonstrate differences in genetic influences on cortical thickness along a dorsal-ventral axis in the same cohort. The phenomenon of orthogonal gradations in cortical organization evident in different structural and functional properties may originate from genetic gradients. Another emerging theme of cortical patterning is that patterns of genetic influences recapitulate the spatial topography of the cortex within hemispheres. The genetic patterning of both cortical thickness and surface area corresponds to cortical functional specializations. Intriguingly, in contrast to broad similarities in genetic patterning, two sets of analyses distinguish cortical thickness and surface area genetically. First, genetic contributions to cortical thickness and surface area are largely distinct; there is very little genetic correlation (i.e., shared genetic influences) between them. Second, organizing principles among genetically defined regions differ between thickness and surface area. Examining the structure of the genetic similarity matrix among clusters revealed that, whereas surface area clusters showed great genetic proximity with clusters from the same lobe, thickness clusters appear to have close genetic relatedness with clusters that have similar maturational timing. The discrepancies are in line with evidence that the two traits follow different mechanisms in neurodevelopment. Our findings highlight the complexity of genetic influences on cortical morphology and provide a glimpse into emerging principles of genetic organization of the cortex.},

	abstract = {With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets. © 2008 Royal Statistical Society.},

After the turn of the century the discov-eries of pervasive pleiotropy and linkage of Mendelian factors revealed the under-lying genetic mechanisms. Existing theory on the dynamics of correlated characters has been developed in the limited frame-work of practical plant and animal breed-ing. Methods of multivariate analysis, functional analysis and optimality criteria popular among evolutionists, do not ac-count for dynamical constraints imposed by the pattern of genetic variation within populations. Consideration of phenotypic variation often does not suggest any clear mecha-nism connecting growth patterns or adult variation to interspecific evolution. When there is individual variation in develop-ment,no necessary correspondence exists between ontogenetic and adult variation in a population (Cock, 1966, pp. 148-151). It is also common for the pattern of adult variation within a species to differ from that at higher taxonomic levels (Simpson, 1953, pp. 25-29). An example which will be investigated here is the brain weight:body weight relationship. At var-ious taxonomic levels, brain and body weights tend to follow the allometric equation brain = k(body)},

A drawback of this strategy is that population stratification can bias the estimates. Indeed, an environmental factor associated with the phenotype may differ among population subgroups. This factor being associated both with the phenotype and the genetic variation in the population would be a confounder. A common solution consists in adjusting on the first Principal Components ({PCs}) of the genomic data. We study this procedure on simulated data and on 6000 individuals from the Three-City Study. We analyse the geographical coordinates of the birth cities, which are not genetically determined, but the heritability of which should be overestimated due to population stratification. We also analyse various anthropometric traits. The procedure fails to correct the bias in geographical coordinates heritability estimates. The heritability estimates of the anthropometric traits are affected by the inclusion of the first {PC}, but not by the following {PCs}, contrarily to geographical coordinates.

	abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of a trait is measured as the proportion of total variance explained by the additive effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Linear mixed models are routinely used to estimate single nucleotide polymorphism heritability for many complex traits, which requires estimation of a genetic relationship matrix among individuals. Heritability is usually estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood or method of moments approaches such as Haseman-Elston regression. The common practice of accounting for such population substructure is to adjust for the top few principal components of the genetic relationship matrix as covariates in the linear mixed model. This can get computationally very intensive on large biobank-scale datasets. Here, we propose a method of moments approach for estimating single nucleotide polymorphism heritability in presence of population substructure. Our proposed method is computationally scalable on biobank datasets and gives an asymptotically unbiased estimate of heritability in presence of discrete substructures. It introduces the adjustments for population stratification in a second-order estimating equation. It allows these substructures to vary in their single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequencies and in their trait distributions (means and variances) while the heritability is assumed to be the same across these substructures. Through extensive simulation studies and the application on 7 quantitative traits in the {UK} Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that our proposed method performs well in the presence of population substructure and much more computationally efficient than existing approaches.},

For example, shape measurements derived from brain {MRI} scans are multidimensional geometric descriptions of brain structure and provide an alternate class of phenotypes that remains largely unexplored in genetic studies. Here we extend the concept of heritability to multidimensional traits, and present the first comprehensive analysis of the heritability of neuroanatomical shape measurements across an ensemble of brain structures based on genome-wide {SNP} and {MRI} data from 1,320 unrelated, young and healthy individuals. We replicate our findings in an extended twin sample from the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}). Our results demonstrate that neuroanatomical shape can be significantly heritable, above and beyond volume, and can serve as a complementary phenotype to study the genetic determinants and clinical relevance of brain structure. Neuroanatomical shape measurements are multidimensional geometric descriptions of brain structure. This study develops multivariate heritability analysis methods and examines structural brain {MRI} scans and genetic data to estimate the heritability of neuroanatomical shape.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Heritability, the proportion of variation in a trait that can be explained by genetic variation, is an important parameter in efforts to understand the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes as well as in the design and interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Attempts to understand the heritability of complex phenotypes attributable to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) variation data has motivated the analysis of large datasets as well as the development of sophisticated tools to estimate heritability in these datasets. Linear mixed models ({LMMs}) have emerged as a key tool for heritability estimation where the parameters of the {LMMs}, i.e. the variance components, are related to the heritability attributable to the {SNPs} analyzed. Likelihood-based inference in {LMMs}, however, poses serious computational burdens. Results: We propose a scalable randomized algorithm for estimating variance components in {LMMs}. Our method is based on a method-of-moment estimator that has a runtime complexity O?{NMB}? for N individuals and M {SNPs} (where B is a parameter that controls the number of random matrix-vector multiplications). Further, by leveraging the structure of the genotype matrix, we can reduce the time complexity to O {NMB}. We demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our method on simulated as well as on empirical data. On standard hardware, our method computes heritability on a dataset of 500 000 individuals and 100 000 {SNPs} in 38 min.},

In this article, we review the recently developed and commonly used {SNP} heritability estimation methods for continuous and binary phenotypes from the perspective of model assumptions and parameter optimization. We primarily focus on their capacity to handle multiple phenotypes and longitudinal measurements, their ability for {SNP} heritability partition and their use of individual-level data versus summary statistics.

Fitting such an {LMM} in a large scale cohort study, however, is tremendously challenging due to its high dimensional linear algebraic operations. In this paper, we propose a new method named {PredLMM} approximating the aforementioned {LMM} motivated by the concepts of genetic coalescence and Gaussian predictive process. {PredLMM} has substantially better computational complexity than most of the existing {LMM} based methods and thus, provides a fast alternative for estimating heritability in large scale cohort studies. Theoretically, we show that under a model of genetic coalescence, the limiting form of our approximation is the celebrated predictive process approximation of large Gaussian process likelihoods that has well-established accuracy standards. We illustrate our approach with extensive simulation studies and use it to estimate the heritability of multiple quantitative traits from the {UK} Biobank cohort.},

We identify 148 clusters of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that replicate at P {\textless} 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity. Our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of the brain that are relevant to neurological and psychiatric disorders, brain development and ageing.

Here, we present a computationally and memory efficient heritability estimation method that can handle large sample sizes, and report the {SNP} heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the interim data release (152,736 subjects) of the large-scale, population-based {UK} Biobank, comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes. We demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes to a broad array of quantitative traits and human diseases in the {UK} population, and identify phenotypes whose heritability is moderated by age (e.g., a majority of physical measures including height and body mass index), sex (e.g., blood pressure related traits) and socioeconomic status (education). Our study represents the first comprehensive phenome-wide heritability analysis in the {UK} Biobank, and underscores the importance of considering population characteristics in interpreting heritability.},

Existing works largely focus on modeling single phenotype and currently available multivariate phenotypic methods often suffer from scaling and interpretation. In this article, motivated by understanding how genetic underpinning impacts human brain variation, we develop an integrative Bayesian heritability analysis to jointly estimate heritabilities for high-dimensional neuroimaging traits. To induce sparsity and incorporate brain anatomical configuration, we impose hierarchical selection among both regional and local measurements based on brain structural network and voxel dependence. We also use a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture model to realize grouping among single nucleotide polymorphism-associated phenotypic variations, providing biological plausibility. Through extensive simulations, we show the proposed method outperforms existing ones in heritability estimation and heritable traits selection under various scenarios. We finally apply the method to two large-scale imaging genetics datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and United Kingdom Biobank and show biologically meaningful results.},
