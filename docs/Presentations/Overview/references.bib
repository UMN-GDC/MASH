	abstract = {Many brain imaging modalities reveal interpretable patterns after the data dimensionality is reduced and summarized via data-driven approaches. In functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies, such summarization is often achieved through independent component analysis ({ICA}). {ICA} transforms the original data into a relatively small number of interpretable bases in voxel space (referred to as {ICA} spatial components, or spatial maps) and corresponding bases in the time domain (referred to as time-courses of corresponding spatial maps) In this work, we use the word “basis” to broadly refer to either of the two factors resulting from the transformation. A precise summarization for {fMRI} requires accurately detecting co-activation of voxels by measuring temporal dependence. Accurate measurement of dependence requires a proper understanding of the underlying temporal characteristics of the data. One way to understand such characteristics is to study the frequency spectrum of {fMRI} data. Researchers have argued that information regarding the underlying neuronal activity might be spread over a range of frequencies as a result of the heterogeneous temporal nature of the neuronal activity, which is reflected in its frequency spectrum. Many studies have accounted for heterogeneous characteristics of the frequency of the signal by either directly inspecting the contents of frequency domain-transformed data or augmenting their analyses with such information. For example, studies on {fMRI} data have investigated brain functional connectivity by leveraging frequency-adjusted measures of dependence (e.g., when a correlation is measured as a function of frequency, as with “coherence”). Although these studies measure dependence as a function of frequency, the formulation does not capture all characteristics of the frequency-based dependence. Incorporating frequency information into a summarization approach would enable the retention of important frequency-related information that exists in the original space but might be lost after performing a frequency-independent summarization. We propose a novel data-driven approach built upon {ICA}, which is based on measuring dependence as a generalized function of frequency. Applying this approach to {fMRI} data provides evidence of existing cross-frequency functional connectivity between different areas of the brain.},

In this paper we take a closer look at the global signal, examining in detail the various sources that can contribute to the signal. For the most part, the global signal has been treated as a nuisance term, but there is growing evidence that it may also contain valuable information. We also examine the various ways that the global signal has been used in the analysis of {fMRI} data, including global signal regression, global signal subtraction, and global signal normalization. Furthermore, we describe new ways for understanding the effects of global signal regression and its relation to the other approaches.},

Such networks are often identified in the context of an {fMRI} scan collected during rest (and thus are called "resting state networks"); however, they are also present during (and modulated by) the performance of a cognitive task. In this article, we will refer to such networks as temporally coherent networks ({TCNs}). Although there is still some debate over the physiological source of these fluctuations, {TCNs} are being studied in a variety of ways. Recent studies have examined ways {TCNs} can be used to identify patterns associated with various brain disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, autism or Alzheimer's disease). Independent component analysis ({ICA}) is one method being used to identify {TCNs}. {ICA} is a data driven approach which is especially useful for decomposing activation during complex cognitive tasks where multiple operations occur simultaneously. In this article we review recent {TCN} studies with emphasis on those that use {ICA}. We also present new results showing that {TCNs} are robust, and can be consistently identified at rest and during performance of a cognitive task in healthy individuals and in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, multiple {TCNs} show temporal and spatial modulation during the cognitive task versus rest. In summary, {TCNs} show considerable promise as potential imaging biological markers of brain diseases, though each network needs to be studied in more detail. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets. © 2008 Royal Statistical Society.},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis ({ICA}) has been widely applied to identify intrinsic brain networks from {fMRI} data. Group {ICA} computes group-level components from all data and subsequently estimates individual-level components to recapture intersubject variability. However, the best approach to handle artifacts, which may vary widely among subjects, is not yet clear. In this work, we study and compare two {ICA} approaches for artifacts removal. One approach, recommended in recent work by the Human Connectome Project, first performs {ICA} on individual subject data to remove artifacts, and then applies a group {ICA} on the cleaned data from all subjects. We refer to this approach as Individual {ICA} based artifacts Removal Plus Group {ICA} ({IRPG}). A second proposed approach, called Group Information Guided {ICA} ({GIG}-{ICA}), performs {ICA} on group data, then removes the group-level artifact components, and finally performs subject-specific {ICAs} using the group-level non-artifact components as spatial references. We used simulations to evaluate the two approaches with respect to the effects of data quality, data quantity, variable number of sources among subjects, and spatially unique artifacts. Resting-state test-retest datasets were also employed to investigate the reliability of functional networks. Results from simulations demonstrate {GIG}-{ICA} has greater performance compared with {IRPG}, even in the case when single-subject artifacts removal is perfect and when individual subjects have spatially unique artifacts. Experiments using test-retest data suggest that {GIG}-{ICA} provides more reliable functional networks. Based on high estimation accuracy, ease of implementation, and high reliability of functional networks, we find {GIG}-{ICA} to be a promising approach. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1005-1025, 2016.},

As a consequence of this rapid growth, the literature on historical trauma comprises disparate terminology and research approaches. This critical review integrates this literature in order to specify theoretical mechanisms that explain how historical trauma influences the health of individuals and communities. We argue that historical trauma functions as a public narrative for particular groups or communities that connects present-day experiences and circumstances to the trauma so as to influence health. Treating historical trauma as a public narrative shifts the research discourse away from an exclusive search for past causal variables that influence health to identifying how present-day experiences, their corresponding narratives, and their health impacts are connected to public narratives of historical trauma for a particular group or community. We discuss how the connection between historical trauma and present-day experiences, related narratives, and health impacts may function as a source of present-day distress as well as resilience. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To understand this crisis, physicians and public health researchers have searched history for insights, especially from a great outbreak approximately a century ago: the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, of the accounts examining the 1918 influenza pandemic and {COVID}-19, only a notable few discuss race. Yet, a rich, broader scholarship on race and epidemic disease as a "sampling device for social analysis" exists. This commentary examines the historical arc of the 1918 influenza pandemic, focusing on black Americans and showing the complex and sometimes surprising ways it operated, triggering particular responses both within a minority community and in wider racial, sociopolitical, and public health structures. This analysis reveals that critical structural inequities and health care gaps have historically contributed to and continue to compound disparate health outcomes among communities of color. Shifting from this context to the present, this article frames a discussion of racial health disparities through a resilience approach rather than a deficit approach and offers a blueprint for approaching the {COVID}-19 crisis and its afterlives through the lens of health equity.},

We provide sufficient conditions for identifying the average causal effects of the functional mediators using the extended {SEM}, as well as weaker conditions under which an instrumental variable estimand may be interpreted as an effect.

	abstract = {Background: Cerebrovascular reactivity ({CVR}) is an important aspect of brain function, and as such it is important to understand relationship between {CVR} and functional connectivity. Methods: This research studied the role of {CVR}, or the brain's ability to react to vasoactive stimuli on brain functional connectivity by scanning subjects with blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ({BOLD}) functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) while they periodically inhale room air and a {CO} 2-enriched gas mixture. We developed a new metric to measure the effect of {CVR} on each intrinsic connectivity network ({ICN}), which contrasts to voxel-wise {CVR}. We also studied the changes in whole-brain connectivity patterns using both static functional network connectivity ({sFNC}) and dynamic {FNC} ({dFNC}). Results: We found that network connectivity is generally weaker during vascular dilation, which is supported by previous research. The {dFNC} analysis revealed that participants did not return to the pre-{CO} 2 inhalation state, suggesting that one-minute periods of room-air inhalation is not enough for the {CO} 2 effect to fully dissipate. Conclusions: Cerebrovascular reactivity is one tool that the cerebrovascular system uses to ensure the constant, finely-tuned flow of oxygen to function properly. Understanding the relationship between {CVR} and brain dynamism can provide unique information about cerebrovascular diseases and general brain function. We observed that {CVR} has a wide, but consistent relationship to connectivity patterns between functional networks.},

However, these methods mostly analyze the dynamic associations across the activation patterns of the spatial networks while assuming that the spatial networks are stationary.

Independent vector analysis ({IVA}) is a joint blind source separation technique that allows for estimation of spatial and temporal features while successfully preserving variability. However, its performance is affected for higher number of datasets. Hence, we develop an effective two-stage method to extract time-varying spatial and temporal features using {IVA}, mitigating the problems with higher number of datasets while preserving the variability across subjects and time. The first stage is used to extract reference signals using group-independent component analysis ({GICA}) that are used in a parameter-tuned constrained {IVA} framework to estimate time-varying representations of these signals by preserving the variability through tuning the constraint parameter. This approach effectively captures variability across time from a large-scale resting-state {fMRI} data acquired from healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia and identifies more functionally relevant connections that are significantly different among healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia, compared with the widely used {GICA} method alone.},

Strong links in the network represent consecutive recurrent events between cells. The chronnet construction process is fast, making the model suitable to process large data sets. Using artificial and real data sets, we show how chronnets can capture data properties beyond simple statistics, like frequent patterns, spatial changes, outliers, and spatiotemporal clusters.

	abstract = {The public health ({PH}) sector is ideally situated to take a lead advocacy role in catalysing and guiding multi-sectoral action to address social determinants of health inequities, but evidence suggests that {PH}'s advocacy role has not been fully realised. The purpose of this review was to determine the extent to which the {PH} advocacy literature addresses the goal of reducing health and social inequities, and to increase understanding of contextual factors shaping the discourse and practice of {PH} advocacy. We employed scoping review methods to systematically examine and chart peer-reviewed and grey literature on {PH} advocacy published from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2015. Databases and search engines used included: {PubMed}, {CINAHL}, {PsycINFO}, Social Sciences Citation Index, Google Scholar, Google, Google Books, {ProQuest} Dissertations and Theses, Grey Literature Report. A total of 183 documents were charted, and included in the final analysis. Thematic analysis was both inductive and deductive according to the objectives. Although {PH} advocacy to address root causes of health inequities is supported theoretically and through professional practice standards, the empirical literature does not reflect that this is occurring widely in {PH} practice. Tensions within the discourse were noted and multiple barriers to engaging in {PH} advocacy for health equity were identified, including a preoccupation with individual responsibilities for healthy lifestyles and behaviours, consistent with the emergence of neoliberal governance. If the {PH} sector is to fulfil its advocacy role in catalysing action to reduce health inequities, it will be necessary to address advocacy barriers at multiple levels, promote multi-sectoral efforts that implicate the state and corporations in the production of health inequities, and rally state involvement to redress these injustices.},

Applications for gene tree distributions include determining exact probabilities of topological equivalence between gene trees and species trees and inferring species trees from multiple datasets. In addition, we examine the shapes of gene tree distributions and their sensitivity to changes in branch lengths, species tree shape, and tree size.

	abstract = {Animal data show that cortical development is initially patterned by genetic gradients largely along three orthogonal axes. We previously reported differences in genetic influences on cortical surface area along an anterior-posterior axis using neuroimaging data of adult human twins. Here, we demonstrate differences in genetic influences on cortical thickness along a dorsal-ventral axis in the same cohort. The phenomenon of orthogonal gradations in cortical organization evident in different structural and functional properties may originate from genetic gradients. Another emerging theme of cortical patterning is that patterns of genetic influences recapitulate the spatial topography of the cortex within hemispheres. The genetic patterning of both cortical thickness and surface area corresponds to cortical functional specializations. Intriguingly, in contrast to broad similarities in genetic patterning, two sets of analyses distinguish cortical thickness and surface area genetically. First, genetic contributions to cortical thickness and surface area are largely distinct; there is very little genetic correlation (i.e., shared genetic influences) between them. Second, organizing principles among genetically defined regions differ between thickness and surface area. Examining the structure of the genetic similarity matrix among clusters revealed that, whereas surface area clusters showed great genetic proximity with clusters from the same lobe, thickness clusters appear to have close genetic relatedness with clusters that have similar maturational timing. The discrepancies are in line with evidence that the two traits follow different mechanisms in neurodevelopment. Our findings highlight the complexity of genetic influences on cortical morphology and provide a glimpse into emerging principles of genetic organization of the cortex.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a period of social, psychological and biological development. During adolescence, relationships with others become more complex, peer relationships are paramount and social cognition develops substantially. These psychosocial changes are paralleled by structural and functional changes in the brain. Existing research in adolescent neurocognitive development has focused largely on averages, but this obscures meaningful individual variation in development. In this Perspective, we propose that the field should now move toward studying individual differences. We start by discussing individual variation in structural and functional brain development. To illustrate the importance of considering individual differences in development, we consider three sources of variation that contribute to neurocognitive processing: socioeconomic status, culture and peer environment. To assess individual differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories, large-scale longitudinal datasets are required. Future developmental neuroimaging studies should attempt to characterize individual differences to move toward a more nuanced understanding of neurocognitive changes during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Causal inference is of central importance to developmental psychology. Many key questions in the field revolve around improving the lives of children and their families. These include identifying risk factors that if manipulated in some way would foster child development. Such a task inherently involves causal inference: One wants to know whether the risk factor actually causes outcomes. Random assignment is not possible in many instances, and for that reason, psychologists must rely on observational studies. Such studies identify associations, and causal interpretation of such associations requires additional assumptions. Research in developmental psychology generally has relied on various forms of linear regression, but this methodology has limitations for causal inference. Fortunately, methodological developments in various fields are providing new tools for causal inference-tools that rely on more plausible assumptions. This article describes the limitations of regression for causal inference and describes how new tools might offer better causal inference. This discussion highlights the importance of properly identifying covariates to include (and exclude) from the analysis. This discussion considers the directed acyclic graph for use in accomplishing this task. With the proper covariates having been chosen, many of the available methods rely on the assumption of "ignorability." The article discusses the meaning of ignorability and considers alternatives to this assumption, such as instrumental variables estimation. Finally, the article considers the use of the tools discussed in the context of a specific research question, the effect of family structure on child development.},

Using functional imaging data in a neutral brain-state we first identify the “brain age” of a given individual then validate it with an independent measure of cortical thickness. We then show, on average, that “brain age” across the group during the teen years has the propensity to look younger in emotional contexts. Further, we show this phenotype (i.e. a younger brain age in emotional contexts) relates to a group mean difference in risk perception − a pattern exemplified greatest in young-adults (ages 18–21). The results are suggestive of a specified functional brain phenotype that relates to being at “risk to be risky.”},

	doi = {10.1007/s10334-010-0197-8},
	abstract = {Objective: In this paper, we develop a dynamic functional network connectivity ({FNC}) analysis approach using correlations between windowed time-courses of different brain networks (components) estimated via spatial independent component analysis ({sICA}). We apply the developed method to {fMRI} data to evaluate it and to study task-modulation of functional connections. Materials and methods: We study the theoretical basis of the approach, perform a simulation analysis and apply it to {fMRI} data from schizophrenia patients ({SP}) and healthy controls ({HC}). Analyses on the {fMRI} data include: (a) group {sICA} to determine regions of significant task-related activity, (b) static and dynamic {FNC} analysis among these networks by using maximal lagged-correlation and time-frequency analysis, and (c) {HC}-{SP} group differences in functional network connections and in task-modulation of these connections. Results: This new approach enables an assessment of task-modulation of connectivity and identifies meaningful inter-component linkages and differences between the two study groups during performance of an auditory oddball task ({AOT}). The static {FNC} results revealed that connectivities involving medial visual-frontal, medial temporal-medial visual, parietal-medial temporal, parietal-medial visual and medial temporal-anterior temporal were significantly greater in {HC}, whereas only the right lateral fronto-parietal ({RLFP})-orbitofrontal connection was significantly greater in {SP}. The dynamic {FNC} revealed that task-modulation of motor-frontal, {RLFP}-medial temporal and posterior default mode ({pDM})-parietal connections were significantly greater in {SP}, and task modulation of orbitofrontal-{pDM} and medial temporal-frontal connections were significantly greater in {HC} (all P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: The task-modulation of dynamic {FNC} provided findings and differences between the two groups that are consistent with the existing hypothesis that schizophrenia patients show less segregated motor, sensory, cognitive functions and less segregated default mode network activity when engaged with a task. Dynamic {FNC}, based on {sICA}, provided additional results which are different than, but complementary to, those of static {FNC}. For example, it revealed dynamic changes in default mode network connectivities with other regions which were significantly different in schizophrenia in terms of task-modulation, findings which were not possible to discover by static {FNC}. © 2010 {ESMRMB}.},

	abstract = {Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new {HCP} subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal ‘fingerprint’ of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6\% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease. A detailed parcellation (map) of the human cerebral cortex has been obtained by integrating multi-modal imaging data, including functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), and the resulting freely available resources will enable detailed comparative studies of the human brain in health, ageing and disease. For more than a century, neuroscientists have sought to subdivide the human cerebral cortex into a patchwork of anatomically and functionally distinct areas. Until now such maps have relied largely on only a single property such as micro-architecture or functional imaging, have been based on a relatively small number of individuals, and have usually been blurry due to misalignment of brain areas from person to person. Matthew Glasser, David Van Essen and colleagues have tackled these deficiencies in a new more 'universal' map of the human cerebral cortex by integrating multi-modal imaging data obtained from 210 healthy subjects and validated on 210 other individuals. The authors propose a total of 180 areas per cerebral hemisphere (97 of them previously unknown) and apply a machine-learning classifier to automatically identify these areas in new subjects, even in individuals with atypical parcellations. This freely available resource will enhance the anatomical accuracy and interpretability of future structural and functional studies of the human brain in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging-based approaches have been extensively applied to study mental illness in recent years and have deepened our understanding of both cognitively healthy and disordered brain structure and function. Recent advancements in machine learning techniques have shown promising outcomes for individualized prediction and characterization of patients with psychiatric disorders. Studies have utilized features from a variety of neuroimaging modalities, including structural, functional, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data, as well as jointly estimated features from multiple modalities, to assess patients with heterogeneous mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. We use the term "predictome" to describe the use of multivariate brain network features from one or more neuroimaging modalities to predict mental illness. In the predictome, multiple brain network-based features (either from the same modality or multiple modalities) are incorporated into a predictive model to jointly estimate features that are unique to a disorder and predict subjects accordingly. To date, more than 650 studies have been published on subject-level prediction focusing on psychiatric disorders. We have surveyed about 250 studies including schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance dependence. In this review, we present a comprehensive review of recent neuroimaging-based predictomic approaches, current trends, and common shortcomings and share our vision for future directions.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} Regression from prediabetes to normal glucose regulation ({NGR}) was associated with reduced incidence of diabetes by 56\% over 10 years in participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study ({DPPOS}). In an observational analysis, we examined whether regression to {NGR} also reduced risk for microvascular disease ({MVD}). {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the prevalence of aggregate {MVD} at {DPPOS} year 11 in people who regressed to {NGR} at least once (vs. never) during the Diabetes Prevention Program ({DPP}). Logistic regression assessed the relationship of {NGR} with retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, individually. Generalized additive models fit smoothing splines to describe the relationship between average A1C during follow-up and {MVD} (and its subtypes) at the end of follow-up. {RESULTS} Regression to {NGR} was associated with lower prevalence of aggregate {MVD} in models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline A1C, and treatment arm (odds ratio [{OR}] 0.78, 95\% {CI} 0.65-0.78, P = 0.011). However, this association was lost in models that included average A1C during follow-up ({OR} 0.95, 95\% {CI} 0.78-1.16, P = 0.63) or diabetes status at the end of follow-up ({OR} 0.92, 95\% {CI} 0.75-1.12, P = 0.40). Similar results were observed in examination of the association between regression to {NGR} and prevalence of nephropathy and retinopathy, individually. Risk for aggregate {MVD}, nephropathy, and retinopathy increased across the A1C range. {CONCLUSIONS} Regression to {NGR} is associated with a lower prevalence of aggregate {MVD}, nephropathy, and retinopathy, primarily due to lower glycemic exposure over time. Differential risk for the {MVD} subtypes begins in the prediabetes A1C range.},

	abstract = {Complex inherited phenotypes, including those for many common medical and psychiatric diseases, are most likely underpinned by multiple genes contributing to interlocking molecular biological processes, along with environmental factors (Owen et al., 2010). Despite this, genotyping strategies for complex, inherited, disease-related phenotypes mostly employ univariate analyses, e.g., genome wide association. Such procedures most often identify isolated risk-related {SNPs} or loci, not the underlying biological pathways necessary to help guide the development of novel treatment approaches. This article focuses on the multivariate analysis strategy of parallel (i.e., simultaneous combination of {SNP} and neuroimage information) independent component analysis (p-{ICA}), which typically yields large clusters of functionally related {SNPs} statistically correlated with phenotype components, whose overall molecular biologic relevance is inferred subsequently using annotation software suites. Because this is a novel approach, whose details are relatively new to the field we summarize its underlying principles and address conceptual questions regarding interpretation of resulting data and provide practical illustrations of the method.},

	abstract = {Motivated by a study on adolescent mental health, we conduct a dynamic connectivity analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data. A dynamic connectivity analysis investigates how the interactions between different regions of the brain, represented by the different dimensions of a multivariate time series, change over time. Hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) and hidden semi-Markov models ({HSMMs}) are common analytic approaches for conducting dynamic connectivity analyses. However, existing approaches for {HSMMs} are limited in their ability to incorporate covariate information. In this work, we approximate an {HSMM} using an {HMM} for modeling multivariate time series data. The approximate {HSMM} model allows one to explicitly model dwell-time distributions that are available to {HSMMs}, while maintaining the theoretical and methodological advances that are available to {HMMs}. We conducted a simulation study to show the performance of the approximate {HSMM} relative to other approaches. Finally, we used the approximate {HSMM} to conduct a dynamic connectivity analysis, where we showed how dwell-time distributions vary across the severity of non-suicidal self-injury ({NSSI}) in female adolescents, and how those with moderate or severe {NSSI} have greater state-switching frequency.},

	abstract = {In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test ({ANT}) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-rain testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the {ANT} produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The {ANT} may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.},

	abstract = {Background: Adolescence is the phase of life between late childhood and adulthood. Typically, adolescents seek diversion, new experiences, and strong emotions, sometimes putting their health at serious risk. In Germany, for example, 62\% of all deaths among persons aged 15 to 20 are due to traumatic injuries. Neuroscientific explanations have been proposed for typical adolescent behavior; with these explanations in mind, one can derive appropriate ways of dealing with adolescents. Method: We selectively review pertinent articles retrieved from the {PubMed} database about the structural and functional development of the brain in adolescence. Results: New findings in developmental psychology and neuroscience reveal that a fundamental reorganization of the brain takes place in adolescence. In postnatal brain development, the maximum density of gray matter is reached first in the primary sensorimotor cortex, and the prefrontal cortex matures last. Subcortical brain areas, especially the limbic system and the reward system, develop earlier, so that there is an imbalance during adolescence between the more mature subcortical areas and less mature prefrontal areas. This may account for typical adolescent behavior patterns, including risk-taking. Conclusion: The high plasticity of the adolescent brain permits environmental influences to exert particularly strong effects on cortical circuitry. While this makes intellectual and emotional development possible, it also opens the door to potentially harmful influences.},

	abstract = {The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ({TOPMed}) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the {TOPMed} goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through {dbGaP} (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) 1. In the first 53,831 {TOPMed} samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in {TOPMed} studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining {TOPMed} haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01\%. Advancing {DNA}-sequencing technologies and decreasing costs are enabling researchers to explore human genetic variation at an unprecedented scale 2,3. For these advances to improve our understanding of human health, they must be deployed in well-phenotyped human samples and used to build resources such as variation catalogues 3,4 , control collections 5,6 and imputation reference panels 7-9. Here we describe high-coverage whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) analyses of the first 53,831 {TOPMed} samples (Box 1 and Extended Data Tables 1, 2); additional data are being made available as quality control, variant calling and {dbGaP} curation are completed (altogether more than 130,000 {TOPMed} samples are now available in {dbGaP}). A key goal of the {TOPMed} programme is to understand risk factors for heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders by adding {WGS} and other 'omics' data to existing studies with deep phenotyping (Supplementary Information 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The programme currently consists of more than 80 participating studies, around 1,000 investigators and more than 30 working groups (https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/ working-groups-public). {TOPMed} participants are ethnically and ancestrally diverse (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 1.1.4 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Through a combination of race and ethnicity information (from participant questionnaires and/or study inclusion criteria), we classified study participants into 'population groups', which varied in composition according to the goals of each analysis. In some analyses, these groups were further refined using genetic ancestry (see Methods and Supplementary Information for details). Our study extends previous efforts by identifying and characterizing the rare variants that comprise the majority of human genomic variation 7,10-12. Rare variants represent recent and potentially deleteri-ous changes that can affect protein function, gene expression or other biologically important elements 11,13,14. {TOPMed} {WGS} quality assessment {WGS} of the {TOPMed} samples was performed over multiple studies, years and sequencing centres. To minimize batch effects, we standardized laboratory methods, mapped and processed sequence data centrally using a single pipeline, and performed variant calling and genotyping jointly across all samples (see Methods). We annotated each variant site with multiple sequence quality metrics and trained machine learning filters to identify and exclude inconsistencies that are revealed when the same individual was sequenced repeatedly. Available {WGS} data were processed periodically to produce genotype data 'freezes'. The 53,831 samples described here are drawn from {TOPMed} freeze 5. Stringent variant and sample quality filters were applied and the resulting genotype call sets were evaluated in several ways (Supple-mentary Information 1.2.2, 1.3, 1.4). First, we compared genotypes for samples sequenced in duplicate (the mean alternative allele concordance was 0.9995 for single-nucleotide variants ({SNVs}) and 0.9930 for insertions or deletions (indels)). Second, we compared genotypes to those from previous whole-exome sequencing datasets (protein-coding regions from {GENCODE} 15 ; 80\% of variants were found with both approaches and overlapping variant calls had a concordance of 0.9993 for {SNVs} and 0.9974 for indels) (Supplementary Tables 1-3).

By doing so, we recover long-run frequency properties among selected hypotheses analogous to those that apply in the classical (non-adaptive) context. Our proposal is closely related to data splitting and has a similar intuitive justification, but is more powerful. Exploiting the classical theory of Lehmann and Scheffé (1955), we derive most powerful unbiased selective tests and confidence intervals for inference in exponential family models after arbitrary selection procedures. For linear regression, we derive new selective z-tests that generalize recent proposals for inference after model selection and improve on their power, and new selective t-tests that do not require knowledge of the error variance.},

	abstract = {Motivation Genome-wide association studies are now shifting focus from analysis of common to rare variants. As power for association testing for individual rare variants may often be low, various aggregate level association tests have been proposed to detect genetic loci. Typically, power calculations for such tests require specification of large number of parameters, including effect sizes and allele frequencies of individual variants, making them difficult to use in practice. We propose to approximate power to a varying degree of accuracy using a smaller number of key parameters, including the total genetic variance explained by multiple variants within a locus. Results We perform extensive simulation studies to assess the accuracy of the proposed approximations in realistic settings. Using these simplified power calculations, we develop an analytic framework to obtain bounds on genetic architecture of an underlying trait given results from genome-wide association studies with rare variants. Finally, we provide insights into the required quality of annotation/functional information for identification of likely causal variants to make meaningful improvement in power.

	abstract = {Brain networks are increasingly understood as one of a large class of information processing systems that share important organizational principles in common, including the property of a modular community structure. A module is topologically defined as a subset of highly inter-connected nodes which are relatively sparsely connected to nodes in other modules. In brain networks, topological modules are often made up of anatomically neighboring and/or functionally related cortical regions, and inter-modular connections tend to be relatively long distance. Moreover, brain networks and many other complex systems demonstrate the property of hierarchical modularity, or modularity on several topological scales: within each module there will be a set of sub-modules, and within each sub-module a set of sub-sub-modules, etc. There are several general advantages to modular and hierarchically modular network organization, including greater robustness, adaptivity, and evolvability of network function. In this context, we review some of the mathematical concepts available for quantitative analysis of (hierarchical) modularity in brain networks and we summarize some of the recent work investigating modularity of structural and functional brain networks derived from analysis of human neuroimaging data. © 2010 Meunier, Lambiotte and Bullmore.},

Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported. This paper details the important considerations necessary when designing any simulation study, including defining specific objectives of the study, determining the procedures for generating the data sets and the number of simulations to perform. A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided.

In this discursive paper, we argue that cultural humility ought to be implemented as the best practice approach for fostering sexually and gender diverse positive spaces in public health settings. A paradigm shift away from cultural competence frameworks toward cultural humility is necessary. This shift can be achieved by enhancing educational opportunities for public health nursing students and professionals and by recruiting organizational leaders to be champions for systemic change. In order to achieve this, we must establish effective educational programs that espouse cultural humility practices and develop valid measurement tools for assessing the provision of culturally humble care. This would equip educators, students, practitioners, and organizational leaders with the necessary tools to guide and assess their performance. Integrating a culturally humble approach will ultimately enhance self-reported cultural safety in public health spaces and reduce health inequities experienced by sexually and/or gender diverse clients and staff members.},

Here, we propose that the current conception of depression is misguiding basic and clinical research. Redefinition is necessary and could include a focus on a more narrowly defined set of core symptoms. However, we conclude that depression is better defined as the tendency to enter into, and inability to disengage from, a negative mood state rather than the mood state per se. We also discuss the implications of this revised definition for future clinical and basic research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Given behavioral findings that children with {ADHD} have more difficulty sustaining attention and more extreme moment-to-moment fluctuations in behavior than typically developing ({TD}) children, recently developed methods to assess changes in connectivity over shorter time periods (i.e., “dynamic functional connectivity”), may provide unique insight into dysfunctional network organization in {ADHD}. Thus, we performed a dynamic functional connectivity ({FC}) analysis on resting state {fMRI} data from 38 children with {ADHD} and 79 {TD} children. We used Hidden semi-Markov models ({HSMMs}) to estimate six network states, as well as the most probable sequence of states for each participant. We quantified the dwell time, sojourn time, and transition probabilities across states. We found that children with {ADHD} spent less total time in, and switched more quickly out of, anticorrelated states involving the default mode network and task-relevant networks as compared to {TD} children. Moreover, children with {ADHD} spent more time in a hyperconnected state as compared to {TD} children. These results provide novel evidence that underlying dynamics may drive the differences in static {FC} patterns that have been observed in {ADHD} and imply that disrupted {FC} dynamics may be a mechanism underlying the behavioral symptoms and cognitive deficits commonly observed in children with {ADHD}.},

	abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10–30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about the relative incidence of fatal and non-fatal self-harm in young people. We estimated the incidence of suicide, hospital-presenting non-fatal self-harm, and community-occurring non-fatal self-harm in adolescents in England. Methods: We used national mortality statistics (Jan 1, 2011, to Dec 31, 2013), hospital monitoring data for five hospitals derived from the Multicentre Study of Self-Harm in England (Jan 1, 2011, to Dec 31, 2013), and data from a schools survey (2015) to estimate the incidence of fatal and non-fatal self-harm per 100 000 person-years in adolescents aged 12–17 years in England. We described these incidences in terms of an iceberg model of self-harm. Findings: During 2011–13, 171 adolescents aged 12–17 years died by suicide in England (119 [70\%] male and 133 [78\%] aged 15–17 years) and 1320 adolescents presented to the study hospitals following non-fatal self-harm (1028 [78\%] female and 977 [74\%] aged 15–17 years). In 2015, 322 (6\%) of 5506 adolescents surveyed reported self-harm in the past year in the community (250 [78\%] female and 164 [51\%] aged 15–17 years). In 12–14 year olds, for every boy who died by suicide, 109 attended hospital following self-harm and 3067 reported self-harm in the community, whereas for every girl who died by suicide, 1255 attended hospital for self-harm and 21 995 reported self-harm in the community. In 15–17 year olds, for every male suicide, 120 males presented to hospital with self-harm and 838 self-harmed in the community; whereas for every female suicide, 919 females presented to hospital for self-harm and 6406 self-harmed in the community. Hanging or asphyxiation was the most common method of suicide (125 [73\%] of 171), self-poisoning was the main reason for presenting to hospital after self-harm (849 [71\%] of 1195), and self-cutting was the main method of self-harm used in the community (286 [89\%] of 322). Interpretation: Ratios of fatal to non-fatal rates of self-harm differed between males and females and between adolescents aged 12–14 years and 15–17 years, with a particularly large number of females reporting self-harm in the community. Our findings emphasise the need for well resourced community and hospital-based mental health services for adolescents, with greater investment in school-based prevention.

	abstract = {We describe the problem of "selective inference." This addresses the following challenge: Having mined a set of data to find potential associations, how do we properly assess the strength of these associations? The fact that we have "cherry-picked" - searched for the strongest associations - means that we must set a higher bar for declaring significant the associations that we see. This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated. We describe some recent new developments in selective inference and illustrate their use in forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis.},

	abstract = {Climate can affect individual health through a number of mechanisms, including changes in food access or availability, heat stress, and drought. Each of these mechanisms are mediated by decisions that individuals, households, and communities make, and so associations between climate change and health outcomes that do not account for these pathways can disguise true effects. In a recent study examining the link between climate variables and health in Mali and Kenya, authors found compelling evidence that precipitation, temperature, and vegetation all have an effect on birthweight. 1 A similar study examined how the climatic characteristics of a region affected growth trajectories of children under five years of age, including potentially moderating variables like transportation and health infrastructure. 2 Both studies note that although rainfall during key periods is typically associated with positive growth trajectories, quantitative associations are heterogeneous across individuals. Moreover, the associations are not fully explained after controlling for variation due to land use, food availability, infrastructure, or individual-level or household-level characteristics. Climate-health researchers have attributed the unexplained variation to a range of factors, from the adoption of modern agricultural techniques, to transportation and health infrastructure, to nutrition and care practices. The pathways proposed in quantitative climate-health studies generally come from qualitative assessments of context made by the researchers, but the directionality of those pathways is not always clear. 3,4 For instance, studies focused on investigating the association between malnutrition and climate propose that the relationship between weather conditions and child health outcomes can be partially explained by the ways a caretaker's workload changes in response to weather. In theory, children are healthier when caretakers have adequate time to care for the children. 5 In practice, increased rainfall could result in greater crop yields, but create more demand for a caretaker's labor, leaving children to eat less frequently. 6,7 Equally, dry conditions and high temperatures could result in more time on heatwave mitigation efforts and less time focused on childcare. It is also possible that extreme temperatures force individuals to spend more time indoors or close to home, resulting in more time left for caretaking. This example shows how individuals can have different responses to the same extreme weather conditions, resulting in varying health outcomes. Because responses to climate are highly contextual, quantitative analyses that do not explicitly model relevant aspects of the local context can produce misleading results. To advance climate-health research and associated policies, the research community should focus on identifying, isolating, and understanding the different ways that individuals respond to climate events. Strictly quantitative analyses have provided promising insights into climate-health linkages but are limited in their ability to capture experiences relevant to local contexts and cultures. 8 To capture variability in these dynamics, attention must be paid to local norms surrounding the ways that people interact and spend their time. Local stakeholders (all individuals in an area, including those living in the communities of interest as well as local policymakers, health workers, and educators) manage complex risks in everyday practice, and using available resources and risk mitigation strategies can provide valuable insights into research. These local stakeholders can provide unique perspectives on a range of highly relevant behavioural responses, including those related to time management, food rationing, caretaking practices, and other strategies used to reduce the adverse effects of climate change. Accessing and chronicling this information allows researchers and policy makers to better determine the ways a household and community respond to aberrant climate events. Unfortunately, standard demographic and health surveys used for climate-health research rarely capture local norms surrounding the ways that people interact. To remedy this, we suggest augmenting climate-health research with qualitative methodologies and field},

Several multi-subject {ICA} approaches estimating subject-specific time courses ({TCs}) and spatial maps ({SMs}) have been developed, however, there has not yet been a full comparison of the implications of their use. Here, we provide extensive comparisons of four multi-subject {ICA} approaches in combination with data reduction methods for simulated and {fMRI} task data. For multi-subject {ICA}, the data first undergo reduction at the subject and group levels using principal component analysis ({PCA}). Comparisons of subject-specific, spatial concatenation, and group data mean subject-level reduction strategies using {PCA} and probabilistic {PCA} ({PPCA}) show that computationally intensive {PPCA} is equivalent to {PCA}, and that subject-specific and group data mean subject-level {PCA} are preferred because of well-estimated {TCs} and {SMs}. Second, aggregate independent components are estimated using either noise-free {ICA} or probabilistic {ICA} ({PICA}). Third, subject-specific {SMs} and {TCs} are estimated using back-reconstruction. We compare several direct group {ICA} ({GICA}) back-reconstruction approaches ({GICA}1-{GICA}3) and an indirect back-reconstruction approach, spatio-temporal regression ({STR}, or dual regression). Results show the earlier group {ICA} ({GICA}1) approximates {STR}, however {STR} has contradictory assumptions and may show mixed-component artifacts in estimated {SMs}. Our evidence-based recommendation is to use {GICA}3, introduced here, with subject-specific {PCA} and noise-free {ICA}, providing the most robust and accurate estimated {SMs} and {TCs} in addition to offering an intuitive interpretation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) for complex diseases often collect data on multiple correlated endo-phenotypes. Multivariate analysis of these correlated phenotypes can improve the power to detect genetic variants. Multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA}) can perform such association analysis at a {GWAS} level, but the behavior of {MANOVA} under different trait models has not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we show that {MANOVA} is generally very powerful for detecting association but there are situations, such as when a genetic variant is associated with all the traits, where {MANOVA} may not have any detection power. In these situations, marginal model based methods, however, perform much better than multivariate methods. We investigate the behavior of {MANOVA}, both theoretically and using simulations, and derive the conditions where {MANOVA} loses power. Based on our findings, we propose a unified score-based test statistic {USAT} that can perform better than {MANOVA} in such situations and nearly as well as {MANOVA} elsewhere. Our proposed test reports an approximate asymptotic P-value for association and is computationally very efficient to implement at a {GWAS} level. We have studied through extensive simulations the performance of {USAT}, {MANOVA}, and other existing approaches and demonstrated the advantage of using the {USAT} approach to detect association between a genetic variant and multivariate phenotypes. We applied {USAT} to data from three correlated traits collected on 5, 816 Caucasian individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ({ARIC}, The {ARIC} Investigators [1989]) Study and detected some interesting associations.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI}. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surfacebased alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex ({MT}+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the {MT}+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis ({ICA}), a data-driven approach utilizing high-order statistical moments to find maximally independent sources, has found fruitful application in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). A limitation of the standard {fMRI} {ICA} model is that a given component's time course is required to have the same delay at every voxel. As spatially varying delays ({SVDs}) may be found in {fMRI} data, using an {ICA} model with a fixed temporal delay for each source will have two implications. Larger {SVDs} can result in the splitting of regions with different delays into different components. Second, smaller {SVDs} can result in a biased {ICA} amplitude estimate due to only a slight delay difference. We propose a straightforward approach for incorporating this prior temporal information and removing the limitation of a fixed source delay by performing {ICA} on the amplitude spectrum of the original {fMRI} data (thus removing latency information). A latency map is then estimated for each component using the resulting component images and the raw data. We show that voxels with similar time courses, but different delays, are grouped into the same component. Additionally, when using traditional {ICA}, the amplitudes of motor areas are diminished due to systematic delay differences between visual and motor areas. The amplitudes are more accurately estimated when using a latency-insensitive {ICA} approach. The resulting time courses, the component maps, and the latency maps may prove useful as an addition to the collection of methods for {fMRI} data analysis. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Recent advances in the mathematics of graph theory have provided tools with which to study networks. These tools can be employed to understand how the brain's behavioral repertoire is mediated by the interactions of objects of information processing. Within the graph-theoretic framework, networks are defined by independent objects (nodes) and the relationships shared between them (edges). Importantly, the accurate incorporation of graph theory into the study of brain networks mandates careful consideration of the assumptions, constraints, and principles of both the mathematics and the underlying neurobiology. This review focuses on understanding these principles and how they guide what constitutes a brain network and its elements, specifically focusing on resting-state correlations in humans. We argue that approaches that fail to take the principles of graph theory into consideration and do not reflect the underlying neurobiological properties of the brain will likely mischaracterize brain network structure and function. © 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by functional dysconnectivity or abnormal integration between distant brain regions. Recent functional imaging studies have implicated large-scale thalamo-cortical connectivity as being disrupted in patients. However, observed connectivity differences in schizophrenia have been inconsistent between studies, with reports of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between the same brain regions. Using resting state eyes-closed functional imaging and independent component analysis on a multi-site data that included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls, we decomposed the functional brain data into 100 components and identified 47 as functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. We subsequently evaluated group differences in functional network connectivity, both in a static sense, computed as the pairwise Pearson correlations between the full network time courses (5.4 minutes in length), and a dynamic sense, computed using sliding windows (44 s in length) and k-means clustering to characterize five discrete functional connectivity states. Static connectivity analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients show significantly stronger connectivity, i.e., hyperconnectivity, between the thalamus and sensory networks (auditory, motor and visual), as well as reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) between sensory networks from all modalities. Dynamic analysis suggests that (1), on average, schizophrenia patients spend much less time than healthy controls in states typified by strong, large-scale connectivity, and (2), that abnormal connectivity patterns are more pronounced during these connectivity states. In particular, states exhibiting cortical-subcortical antagonism (anti-correlations) and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Group differences are weak or absent during other connectivity states. Dynamic analysis also revealed hypoconnectivity between the putamen and sensory networks during the same states of thalamic hyperconnectivity; notably, this finding cannot be observed in the static connectivity analysis. Finally, in post-hoc analyses we observed that the relationships between sub-cortical low frequency power and connectivity with sensory networks is altered in patients, suggesting different functional interactions between sub-cortical nuclei and sensorimotor cortex during specific connectivity states. While important differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls have been identified, one should interpret the results with caution given the history of medication in patients. Taken together, our results support and expand current knowledge regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, and strongly advocate the use of dynamic analyses to better account for and understand functional connectivity differences. © 2014 The Authors.

The suicide rate for males aged 15–19 years increased from 12.0 to 18.1 per 100,000 population from 1975 to 1990, declined to 10.8 by 2007, and then increased 31\% to 14.2 by 2015. The rate in 2015 for males was still lower than the peak rates in the mid- 1980s to mid-1990s. Rates for females aged 15–19 were lower than for males aged 15–19 but followed a similar pattern during 1975–2007 (increasing from 2.9 to 3.7 from 1975 to 1990, followed by a decline from 1990 to 2007). The rates for females then doubled from 2007 to 2015 (from 2.4 to 5.1). The rate in 2015 was the highest for females for the 1975–2015 period. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm},

Aims To gain perspective of parents of adolescents who self-harm on: (a) history of self-harm and health service provision; (b) their understanding and ability to make sense of self-harm behaviour; (c) emotional and personal impact; and (d) parent skills as carer and hope for the future. Method Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to semi-structured interviews with 12 parents of adolescents receiving treatment for self-harm in community child and adolescent mental health services. Results Parents commonly suspected and spotted self-harm prior to disclosure or service contact; however, communication difficulties and underestimating significance led to delays in addressing the behaviour. Parents struggled to understand and cope with self-harm. Conclusions Parents require advice and support from outside services to help them manage self-harming behaviour and its personal impact. This study suggests parents are early to spot signs of self-harm, indicating their key role in reaching young people in the community who remain unknown to health services.},

Abrupt transitions in resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) patterns can noninvasively identify locations of putative borders between cortical areas ({RSFC}-boundary mapping; Cohen et al. 2008). Here we describe a technique for using {RSFC}-boundary maps to define parcels that represent putative cortical areas. These parcels had highly homogenous {RSFC} patterns, indicating that they contained one unique {RSFC} signal; furthermore, the parcels were much more homogenous than a null model matched for parcel size when tested in two separate datasets. Several alternative parcellation schemes were tested this way, and no other parcellation was as homogenous as or had as large a difference compared with its null model. The boundary map-derived parcellation contained parcels that overlapped with architectonic mapping of areas 17, 2, 3, and 4. These parcels had a network structure similar to the known network structure of the brain, and their connectivity patterns were reliable across individual subjects. These observations suggest that {RSFC}-boundary map-derived parcels provide information about the location and extent of human cortical areas.

	abstract = {Many mental illnesses share overlapping or similar clinical symptoms, confounding the diagnosis. It is important to systematically characterize the degree to which unique and similar changing patterns are reflective of brain disorders. Increasing sharing initiatives on neuroimaging data have provided unprecedented opportunities to study brain disorders. However, it is still an open question on replicating and translating findings across studies. Standardized approaches for capturing reproducible and comparable imaging markers are greatly needed. Here, we propose a pipeline based on the priori-driven independent component analysis, {NeuroMark}, which is capable of estimating brain functional network measures from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data that can be used to link brain network abnormalities among different datasets, studies, and disorders. {NeuroMark} automatically estimates features adaptable to each individual subject and comparable across datasets/studies/disorders by taking advantage of the reliable brain network templates extracted from 1828 healthy controls as guidance. Four studies including 2442 subjects were conducted spanning six brain disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder) to evaluate validity of the proposed pipeline from different perspectives (replication of brain abnormalities, cross-study comparison, identification of subtle brain changes, and multi-disorder classification using identified biomarkers). Our results highlight that {NeuroMark} effectively identified replicated brain network abnormalities of schizophrenia across different datasets; revealed interesting neural clues on the overlap and specificity between autism and schizophrenia; demonstrated brain functional impairments present to varying degrees in mild cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's disease; and captured biomarkers that achieved good performance in classifying bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.},

We use an approach designed to find repeating network patterns in whole-brain resting {fMRI} data, where networks are defined as graphs of interacting brain areas. We find that the transitions between networks are nonrandom, with certain networks more likely to occur after others. Further, this nonrandom sequencing is itself hierarchically organized, revealing two distinct sets of networks, or metastates, that the brain has a tendency to cycle within. One metastate is associated with sensory and motor regions, and the other involves areas related to higher order cognition. Moreover, we find that the proportion of time that a subject spends in each brain network and metastate is a consistent subject-specific measure, is heritable, and shows a significant relationship with cognitive traits.},

	abstract = {The Iowa Gambling Task ({IGT}) has contributed greatly to the study of affective decision making. However, researchers have observed high inter-study and inter-individual variability in {IGT} performance in healthy participants, and many are classified as impaired using standard criteria. Additionally, while decision-making deficits are often attributed to atypical sensitivity to reward and/or punishment, the {IGT} lacks an integrated sensitivity measure. Adopting an operant perspective, two experiments were conducted to explore these issues. In Experiment 1, 50 healthy participants completed a 200-trial version of the {IGT} which otherwise closely emulated Bechara et al.'s (1999) original computer task. Group data for Trials 1-100 closely replicated Bechara et al.'s original findings of high net scores and preferences for advantageous decks, suggesting that implementations that depart significantly from Bechara's standard {IGT} contribute to inter-study variability. During Trials 101-200, mean net scores improved significantly and the percentage of participants meeting the "impaired" criterion was halved. An operant-style stability criterion applied to individual data revealed this was likely related to individual differences in learning rate. Experiment 2 used a novel operant card task-the Auckland Card Task ({ACT})-to derive quantitative estimates of sensitivity using the generalized matching law. Relative to individuals who mastered the {IGT}, persistent poor performers on the {IGT} exhibited significantly lower sensitivity to magnitudes (but not frequencies) of rewards and punishers on the {ACT}. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of operant-style analysis of {IGT} data and the potential of applying operant concurrent-schedule procedures to the study of human decision making.},

Knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of these interactions is critical for establishing a solid understanding of the brain’s functional architecture and the relationship between neural dynamics and cognition in health and disease. The possibility of studying these dynamics through careful analysis of neuroimaging data has catalyzed substantial interest in methods that estimate time-resolved fluctuations in functional connectivity (often referred to as “dynamic” or time-varying functional connectivity; {TVFC}). At the same time, debates have emerged regarding the application of {TVFC} analyses to resting {fMRI} data, and about the statistical validity, physiological origins, and cognitive and behavioral relevance of resting {TVFC}. These and other unresolved issues complicate interpretation of resting {TVFC} findings and limit the insights that can be gained from this promising new research area. This article brings together scientists with a variety of perspectives on resting {TVFC} to review the current literature in light of these issues. We introduce core concepts, define key terms, summarize controversies and open questions, and present a forward-looking perspective on how resting {TVFC} analyses can be rigorously and productively applied to investigate a wide range of questions in cognitive and systems neuroscience.},

So far, temporal information about {fMRI} has been used in temporal {ICA} or spatial {ICA} as additional constraints to improve estimation of task-related components. Considering that prior information about spatial patterns is also available, a semiblind spatial {ICA} algorithm utilizing the spatial information was proposed within the framework of constrained {ICA} with fixed-point learning. The proposed approach was first tested with synthetic {fMRI}-like data, and then was applied to real {fMRI} data from 11 subjects performing a visuomotor task. Three components of interest including two task-related components and the "default mode" component were automatically extracted, and atlas-defined masks were used as the spatial constraints. The default mode network, a set of regions that appear correlated in particular in the absence of tasks or external stimuli and is of increasing interest in {fMRI} studies, was found to be greatly improved when incorporating spatial prior information. Results from simulation and real {fMRI} data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve {ICA} performance compared to a different semiblind {ICA} algorithm and a standard blind {ICA} algorithm. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Therefore narrow sense heritability, which is both population and trait specific, can be estimated with both population- and family-based samples. In this study we estimate heritability from both family-based and population-based samples, collected in Korea, and the heritability estimates from the pooled samples were, for height, 0.60; body mass index ({BMI}), 0.32; log-transformed triglycerides (log {TG}), 0.24; total cholesterol ({TCHL}), 0.30; high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}), 0.38; low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), 0.29; systolic blood pressure ({SBP}), 0.23; and diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}), 0.24.

	abstract = {Multivariate analysis using mixed models allows for the exploration of genetic correlations between traits. Additionally, the transition to a genomic based approach is simplified by substituting classic pedigrees with a marker-based relationship matrix. It also enables the investigation of correlated responses to selection, trait integration and modularity in different kinds of populations. This study investigated a strategy for the construction of a marker-based relationship matrix that prioritized markers using Partial Least Squares. The efficiency of this strategy was found to depend on the correlation structure between investigated traits. In terms of accuracy, we found no benefit of this strategy compared with the all-marker-based multivariate model for the primary trait of diameter at breast height ({DBH}) in a radiata pine (Pinus radiata) population, possibly due to the presence of strong and well-estimated correlation with other highly heritable traits. Conversely, we did see benefit in a shining gum (Eucalyptus nitens) population, where the primary trait had low or only moderate genetic correlation with other low/moderately heritable traits. Marker selection in multivariate analysis can therefore be an efficient strategy to improve prediction accuracy for low heritability traits due to improved precision in poorly estimated low/moderate genetic correlations. Additionally, our study identified the genetic diversity as a factor contributing to the efficiency of marker selection in multivariate approaches due to higher precision of genetic correlation estimates.},

We used a sample of 515 middle-aged male twins with structural magnetic resonance imaging data to investigate whether the association between height and cognitive ability is mediated by cortical size. In addition to cortical volume, we used genetically, ontogenetically and phylogenetically distinct cortical metrics of total cortical surface area and mean cortical thickness. Height was positively associated with general cognitive ability and total cortical volume and cortical surface area, but not with mean cortical thickness. Mediation models indicated that the well-replicated height-general cognitive ability association is accounted for by individual differences in total cortical volume and cortical surface area (highly heritable metrics related to global brain size), and that the genetic association between cortical surface area and general cognitive ability underlies the phenotypic height-general cognitive ability relationship.},

Ayahuasca is a psychedelic beverage of Amazonian indigenous origin with legal status in Brazil in religious and scientific settings. In this context, we use tools and concepts from the theory of complex networks to analyze resting state {fMRI} data of the brains of human subjects under two distinct conditions: (i) under ordinary waking state and (ii) in an altered state of consciousness induced by ingestion of Ayahuasca. We report an increase in the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution of the networks subsequent to Ayahuasca ingestion. We also find increased local and decreased global network integration. Our results are broadly consistent with the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of descriptions of "mind-expansion" frequently seen in self-reports of users of psychedelic drugs.},

	abstract = {Background: Current theory suggests that treatment-resistant depression ({TRD}) involves impaired neuroplasticity resulting in cognitive and neural rigidity, and that clinical improvement may require increasing brain flexibility and adaptability. Aims: In this hypothesis-generating study, we sought to identify preliminary evidence of brain flexibility correlates of clinical change within the context of an open-label ketamine trial in adolescents with {TRD}, focusing on two promising candidate markers of neural flexibility: (a) entropy of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals; and (b) insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) and glycogen synthase-3-beta ({GSK}3β) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methods: We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and blood samples from 13 adolescents with {TRD} before and after a series of six ketamine infusions over 2 weeks. Usable pre/post ketamine data were available from 11 adolescents for imaging and from 10 adolescents for molecular signaling. We examined correlations between treatment response and changes in the central and peripheral flexibility markers. Results: Depression reduction correlated with increased nucleus accumbens entropy. Follow-up analyses suggested that physiological changes were associated with treatment response. In contrast to treatment non-responders (n=6), responders (n=5) showed greater increase in nucleus accumbens entropy after ketamine, together with greater post-treatment insulin/{mTOR}/{GSK}3β signaling. Conclusions: These data provide preliminary evidence that changes in neural flexibility may underlie symptom relief in adolescents with {TRD} following ketamine. Future research with adequately powered samples is needed to confirm resting-state entropy and insulin-stimulated {mTOR} and {GSK}3β as brain flexibility markers and candidate targets for future clinical trials.

	abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of "primary states" is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit "criticality," i.e., the property of being poised at a "critical" point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network ({DMN}) and a decoupling between the {DMN} and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state. © 2014 Carhart-Harris, Leech, Hellyer, Shanahan, Feilding, Tagliazucchi, Chialvo and Nutt.},

	abstract = {Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access. This study investigates the relationship between human intelligence and brain entropy, to determine whether neural variability as reflected in neuroimaging signals carries information about intellectual ability. We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state {fMRI}. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and {WASI} Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. Future work in this area may elucidate the links between brain entropy in both resting and active states and various forms of intelligence. This insight has the potential to provide predictive information about adaptive behavior and to delineate the subdivisions and nature of intelligence based on entropic patterns.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) continues to drive many important neuroscientific advances. However, progress in uncovering reproducible associations between individual differences in brain structure/function and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25)[1][1],[2][2]. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ({ABCD}) Study[3][3] (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain-wide associations studies ({BWAS}) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain-wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller samples, typical for brain-wide association studies ({BWAS}), irreproducible, inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate, multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium-levels, {BWAS} were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors contribute to replication failures[4][4]–[6][5]; here, we show that the pairing of small brain-behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is a key element in wide-spread {BWAS} replication failure. Brain-behavioral phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample sizes of N⪆2,000. While investigator-initiated brain-behavior research continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible human brain-wide association studies.

However, new methods have appeared for estimating heritabilities using genomewide data from unrelated individuals. A drawback of this strategy is that population stratification can bias the estimates. Indeed, an environmental factor associated with the phenotype may differ among population subgroups. This factor being associated both with the phenotype and the genetic variation in the population would be a confounder. A common solution consists in adjusting on the first Principal Components ({PCs}) of the genomic data. We study this procedure on simulated data and on 6000 individuals from the Three-City Study. We analyse the geographical coordinates of the birth cities, which are not genetically determined, but the heritability of which should be overestimated due to population stratification. We also analyse various anthropometric traits. The procedure fails to correct the bias in geographical coordinates heritability estimates. The heritability estimates of the anthropometric traits are affected by the inclusion of the first {PC}, but not by the following {PCs}, contrarily to geographical coordinates. We recommend to be cautious with heritability estimates obtained from a large population.},

Linear mixed models are routinely used to estimate single nucleotide polymorphism heritability for many complex traits, which requires estimation of a genetic relationship matrix among individuals. Heritability is usually estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood or method of moments approaches such as Haseman-Elston regression. The common practice of accounting for such population substructure is to adjust for the top few principal components of the genetic relationship matrix as covariates in the linear mixed model. This can get computationally very intensive on large biobank-scale datasets. Here, we propose a method of moments approach for estimating single nucleotide polymorphism heritability in presence of population substructure. Our proposed method is computationally scalable on biobank datasets and gives an asymptotically unbiased estimate of heritability in presence of discrete substructures. It introduces the adjustments for population stratification in a second-order estimating equation. It allows these substructures to vary in their single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequencies and in their trait distributions (means and variances) while the heritability is assumed to be the same across these substructures. Through extensive simulation studies and the application on 7 quantitative traits in the {UK} Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that our proposed method performs well in the presence of population substructure and much more computationally efficient than existing approaches.},

Attempts to understand the heritability of complex phenotypes attributable to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) variation data has motivated the analysis of large datasets as well as the development of sophisticated tools to estimate heritability in these datasets. Linear mixed models ({LMMs}) have emerged as a key tool for heritability estimation where the parameters of the {LMMs}, i.e. the variance components, are related to the heritability attributable to the {SNPs} analyzed. Likelihood-based inference in {LMMs}, however, poses serious computational burdens. Results: We propose a scalable randomized algorithm for estimating variance components in {LMMs}. Our method is based on a method-of-moment estimator that has a runtime complexity O?{NMB}? for N individuals and M {SNPs} (where B is a parameter that controls the number of random matrix-vector multiplications). Further, by leveraging the structure of the genotype matrix, we can reduce the time complexity to O {NMB}. We demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our method on simulated as well as on empirical data.

Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity. Our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of the brain that are relevant to neurological and psychiatric disorders, brain development and ageing. Genome-wide association studies of brain imaging data from 8,428 individuals in {UK} Biobank show that many of the 3,144 traits studied are heritable, and genes associated with individual phenotypes are identified.},

	abstract = {With the advent of high throughput genetic data, there have been attempts to estimate heritability from genome-wide {SNP} data on a cohort of distantly related individuals using linear mixed model ({LMM}). Fitting such an {LMM} in a large scale cohort study, however, is tremendously challenging due to its high dimensional linear algebraic operations. In this paper, we propose a new method named {PredLMM} approximating the aforementioned {LMM} motivated by the concepts of genetic coalescence and Gaussian predictive process. {PredLMM} has substantially better computational complexity than most of the existing {LMM} based methods and thus, provides a fast alternative for estimating heritability in large scale cohort studies. Theoretically, we show that under a model of genetic coalescence, the limiting form of our approximation is the celebrated predictive process approximation of large Gaussian process likelihoods that has well-established accuracy standards. We illustrate our approach with extensive simulation studies and use it to estimate the heritability of multiple quantitative traits from the {UK} Biobank cohort.},

Here, we present a computationally and memory efficient heritability estimation method that can handle large sample sizes, and report the {SNP} heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the interim data release (152,736 subjects) of the large-scale, population-based {UK} Biobank, comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes.

We propose a new paradigm, focusing on prediction rather than inference. Our multivariate model predicts the spatial distribution of neurological observations, given text describing an experiment, cognitive process, or disease. This approach handles text of arbitrary length and terms that are too rare for standard meta-analysis. We capture the relationships and neural correlates of 7547 neuroscience terms across 13 459 neuroimaging publications.

	abstract = {Background: Multi-site functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) databases are becoming increasingly prevalent in the study of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. However, multi-site databases are known to introduce site effects that may confound neurobiological and measures such as functional connectivity ({FC}). Although studies have been conducted to mitigate site effects, these methods often result in reduced effect size in {FC} comparisons between controls and patients.Methods: We present a site-wise de-meaning ({SWD}) strategy in multi-site {FC} analysis and compare its performance with two common site-effect mitigation methods, i.e., generalized linear model ({GLM}) and Combining Batches ({ComBat}) Harmonization. For {SWD}, after {FC} was calculated and Fisher z-transformed, the site-wise {FC} mean was removed from each subject before group-level statistical analysis. The above methods were tested on two multi-site psychiatric consortiums [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ({ABIDE}) and Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-{SNIP})]. Preservation of consistent {FC} alterations in patients were evaluated for each method through the effect sizes (Hedge’s g) of patients vs. controls.Results: For the B-{SNIP} dataset, {SWD} improved the effect size between schizophrenic and control subjects by 4.5–7.9\%, while {GLM} and {ComBat} decreased the effect size by 22.5–42.6\%. For the {ABIDE} dataset, {SWD} improved the effect size between autistic and control subjects by 2.9–5.3\%, while {GLM} and {ComBat} decreased the effect size by up to 11.4\%.Conclusion: Compared to the original data and commonly used methods, the {SWD} method demonstrated superior performance in preserving the effect size in {FC} features associated with disorders.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

	abstract = {Site differences, or systematic differences in feature distributions across multiple data-acquisition sites, are a known source of heterogeneity that may adversely affect large-scale meta- and mega-analyses of independently collected neuroimaging data. They influence nearly all multi-site imaging modalities and biomarkers, and methods to compensate for them can improve reliability and generalizability in the analysis of genetics, omics, and clinical data. The origins of statistical site effects are complex and involve both technical differences (scanner vendor, head coil, acquisition parameters, imaging processing) and differences in sample characteristics (inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample size, ancestry) between sites. In an age of expanding international consortium research, there is a growing need to disentangle technical site effects from sample characteristics of interest. Numerous statistical and machine learning methods have been developed to control for, model, or attenuate site effects – yet to date, no comprehensive review has discussed the benefits and drawbacks of each for different use cases. Here, we provide an overview of the different existing statistical and machine learning methods developed to remove unwanted site effects from independently collected neuroimaging samples. We focus on linear mixed effect models, the {ComBat} technique and its variants, adjustments based on image quality metrics, normative modeling, and deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks. For each method, we outline the statistical foundation and summarize strengths and weaknesses, including their assumptions and conditions of use. We provide information on software availability and comment on the ease of use and the applicability of these methods to different types of data.

	abstract = {The potential of normative modeling to make individualized predictions from neuroimaging data has enabled inferences that go beyond the case-control approach. However, site effects are often confounded with variables of interest in a complex manner and can bias estimates of normative models, which has impeded the application of normative models to large multi-site neuroimaging data sets. In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared the performance of a linear and a non-linear hierarchical Bayesian model in modeling the effect of age on cortical thickness. We used data of 570 healthy individuals from the {ABIDE} (autism brain imaging data exchange) data set in our experiments. In addition, we used data from individuals with autism to test whether our models are able to retain clinically useful information while removing site effects. We compared the proposed single stage hierarchical Bayesian method to several harmonization techniques commonly used to deal with additive and multiplicative site effects using a two stage regression, including regressing out site and harmonizing for site with {ComBat}, both with and without explicitly preserving variance related to age and sex as biological variation of interest. In addition, we made predictions from raw data, in which site has not been accommodated for. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian method showed the best predictive performance according to multiple metrics. Beyond that, the resulting z-scores showed little to no residual site effects, yet still retained clinically useful information. In contrast, performance was particularly poor for the regression model and the {ComBat} model in which age and sex were not explicitly modeled. In all two stage harmonization models, predictions were poorly scaled, suffering from a loss of more than 90 \% of the original variance. Our results show the value of hierarchical Bayesian regression methods for accommodating site variation in neuroimaging data, which provides an alternative to harmonization techniques. While the approach we propose may have broad utility, our approach is particularly well suited to normative modelling where the primary interest is in accurate modelling of inter-subject variation and statistical quantification of deviations from a reference model.

We start by first describing the difference between fixed and random-effects meta-analysis, with particular attention devoted to the latter.

We then describe alternative random-effects approaches such as maximum likelihood, restricted maximum likelihood and profile likelihood as well as a non-parametric approach. A brief description of selected statistical programs available to conduct random-effects aggregate data meta-analysis, limited to those that allow both an intercept-only as well as at least one predictor in the model, is given. These descriptions include those found in an existing general statistics software package as well as one developed specifically for an aggregate data meta-analysis. Following this, some of the disadvantages of random-effects meta-analysis are described. We then describe recently proposed alternative models for conducting aggregate data meta-analysis, including the varying coefficient model. We conclude the paper with some recommendations and directions for future research. These recommendations include the continued use of the more commonly used random-effects models until newer models are more thoroughly tested as well as the timely integration of new and well-tested models into traditional as well as meta-analytic-specific software packages.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/858415},
	abstract = {Abstract
          To acquire larger samples for answering complex questions in neuroscience, researchers have increasingly turned to multi-site neuroimaging studies. However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across multiple scanners. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between scanners, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data by removing scanner-related effects in the mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of multivariate pattern analysis ({MVPA}) has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that methods for removing scanner effects in mean and variance may not be sufficient for {MVPA}. This stems from the fact that such methods fail to address how correlations between measurements can vary across scanners. Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is used to show that considerable differences in covariance exist across scanners and that popular harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We also propose a novel methodology that harmonizes covariance of multivariate image measurements across scanners and demonstrate its improved performance in data harmonization.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed {PLINK}, an open-source C/C++ {WGAS} tool set. With {PLINK}, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, {PLINK} also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce {PLINK} and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

This is especially important for genetic studies where a large number of observations are required to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate genetic effects. There is a need to develop and evaluate methods for joint-analytical analyses of rich datasets collected in imaging genetics studies. The {ENIGMA}-{DTI} consortium is developing and evaluating approaches for obtaining pooled estimates of heritability through meta-and mega-genetic analytical approaches, to estimate the general additive genetic contributions to the intersubject variance in fractional anisotropy ({FA}) measured from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). We used the {ENIGMA}-{DTI} data harmonization protocol for uniform processing of {DTI} data from multiple sites. We evaluated this protocol in five family-based cohorts providing data from a total of 2248 children and adults (ages: 9-85) collected with various imaging protocols. We used the imaging genetics analysis tool, {SOLAR}-Eclipse, to combine twin and family data from Dutch, Australian and Mexican-American cohorts into one large "mega-family". We showed that heritability estimates may vary from one cohort to another. We used two meta-analytical (the sample-size and standard-error weighted) approaches and a mega-genetic analysis to calculate heritability estimates across-population. We performed leave-one-out analysis of the joint estimates of heritability, removing a different cohort each time to understand the estimate variability. Overall, meta- and mega-genetic analyses of heritability produced robust estimates of heritability.},

Diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) yields quantitative measures sensitive to brain development and degeneration, and some common genetic variants may be associated with white matter integrity or connectivity. {DTI} measures, such as the fractional anisotropy ({FA}) of water diffusion, may be useful for identifying genetic variants that influence brain microstructure. However, genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) require large populations to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate significant effects, motivating a multi-site consortium effort. As part of an {ENIGMA}–{DTI} working group, we analyzed high-resolution {FA} images from multiple imaging sites across North America, Australia, and Europe, to address the challenge of harmonizing imaging data collected at multiple sites. Four hundred images of healthy adults aged 18–85 from four sites were used to create a template and corresponding skeletonized {FA} image as a common reference space. Using twin and pedigree samples of different ethnicities, we used our common template to evaluate the heritability of tract-derived {FA} measures. We show that our template is reliable for integrating multiple datasets by combining results through meta-analysis and unifying the data through exploratory mega-analyses. Our results may help prioritize regions of the {FA} map that are consistently influenced by additive genetic factors for future genetic discovery studies.

A parcellation framework that relates systematically to fundamental principles of histological organization is an essential step in generating structural comparisons between species. In the present investigation, we developed a comparative parcellation reasoning system ({ComPaRe}), which is a formal ontological system in human and non-human primate brains based on the cortical cytoarchitectonic mapping used for both species as detailed by Brodmann. {ComPaRe} provides a theoretical foundation for mapping neural systems in humans and other species using neuroimaging. Based on this approach, we revised the methodology of the original Harvard-Oxford Atlas ({HOA}) system of brain parcellation to produce a comparative framework for the human ({hHOA}) and the rhesus monkey ({mHOA}) brains, which we refer to as {HOA}2.0-{ComPaRe}. In addition, we used dedicated segmentation software in the publicly available 3D Slicer platform to parcellate an individual human and rhesus monkey brain. This method produces quantitative morphometric parcellations in the individual brains. Based on these parcellations we created a representative template and 3D brain atlas for the two species, each based on a single subject. Thus, {HOA}2.0-{ComPaRe} provides a theoretical foundation for mapping neural systems in humans and other species using neuroimaging, while also representing a significant revision of the original human and macaque monkey {HOA} parcellation schemas. The methodology and atlases presented here can be used in basic and clinical neuroimaging for morphometric (volumetric) analysis, further generation of atlases, as well as localization of function and structural lesions.},

The {MRI} correlates of healthy aging have been extensively investigated using a range of modalities, including volumetric {MRI}, quantitative {MRI} ({qMRI}), and diffusion tensor imaging. Despite this, the reported brainstem related changes remain sparse. This is, in part, due to the technical and methodological limitations in quantitatively assessing and statistically analyzing this region. By utilizing a new method of brainstem segmentation, a large cohort of 100 healthy adults were assessed in this study for the effects of aging within the human brainstem in vivo. Using {qMRI}, tensor-based morphometry ({TBM}), and voxel-based quantification ({VBQ}), the volumetric and quantitative changes across healthy adults between 19 and 75 years were characterized. In addition to the increased R2* in substantia nigra corresponding to increasing iron deposition with age, several novel findings were reported in the current study. These include selective volumetric loss of the brachium conjunctivum, with a corresponding decrease in magnetization transfer and increase in proton density ({PD}), accounting for the previously described “midbrain shrinkage.” Additionally, we found increases in R1 and {PD} in several pontine and medullary structures. We consider these changes in the context of well-characterized, functional age-related changes, and propose potential biophysical mechanisms. This study provides detailed quantitative analysis of the internal architecture of the brainstem and provides a baseline for further studies of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by early, pre-clinical involvement of the brainstem, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.},

It provides valuable insights into cells previously unachieved by bulk cell analysis and is proving crucial in uncovering cellular heterogeneity, identifying rare cell populations, distinct cell-lineage trajectories, and mechanisms involved in complex cellular processes. {SCT} data is highly complex and necessitates advanced statistical and computational methods for analysis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the steps in a typical {SCT} workflow, starting from experimental protocol to data analysis, deliberating various pipelines used.

Such unwanted sources of variation, which we refer to as “scanner effects”, can hinder the detection of imaging features associated with clinical covariates of interest and cause spurious findings. In this paper, we investigate scanner effects in two large multi-site studies on cortical thickness measurements across a total of 11 scanners. We propose a set of tools for visualizing and identifying scanner effects that are generalizable to other modalities. We then propose to use {ComBat}, a technique adopted from the genomics literature and recently applied to diffusion tensor imaging data, to combine and harmonize cortical thickness values across scanners. We show that {ComBat} removes unwanted sources of scan variability while simultaneously increasing the power and reproducibility of subsequent statistical analyses. We also show that {ComBat} is useful for combining imaging data with the goal of studying life-span trajectories in the brain.},

	abstract = {A common limitation of neuroimaging studies is their small sample sizes. To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis ({ENIGMA}) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and sequences. {ENIGMA} projects commonly address this heterogeneity with random-effects meta-analysis or mixed-effects mega-analysis. Here we tested whether the batch adjustment method, {ComBat}, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and {ComBat} mega-analyses to compare cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of {ComBat} substantially increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to random-effects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing {ComBat} with mixed-effects mega-analysis, although {ComBat} still slightly increased the statistical significance. {ComBat} also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we applied the {ComBat} harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the {ComBat} function to attenuate potential effects of site in {ENIGMA} projects and other multi-site structural imaging work. We provide easy-to-use functions in R that work even if imaging data are partially missing in some brain regions, and they can be trained with one data set and then applied to another (a requirement for some analyses such as machine learning).},

As with many other imaging modalities, {DTI} images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy ({FA}) and mean diffusivity ({MD}) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the {DTI} measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining {DTI} data from multiple sites, without harmonization, may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for {DTI} data, and show that {ComBat}, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in {FA} and {MD} maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that {ComBat} both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.},

	abstract = {Acquiring resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) datasets at multiple {MRI} scanners and clinical sites can improve statistical power and generalizability of results. However, multi‐site neuroimaging studies have reported considerable nonbiological variability in {fMRI} measurements due to different scanner manufacturers and acquisition protocols. These undesirable sources of variability may limit power to detect effects of interest and may even result in erroneous findings. Until now, there has not been an approach that removes unwanted site effects. In this study, using a relatively large multi‐site (4 sites) {fMRI} dataset, we investigated the impact of site effects on functional connectivity and network measures estimated by widely used connectivity metrics and brain parcellations. The protocols and image acquisition of the dataset used in this study had been homogenized using identical {MRI} phantom acquisitions from each of the neuroimaging sites; however, intersite acquisition effects were not completely eliminated. Indeed, in this study, we found that the magnitude of site effects depended on the choice of connectivity metric and brain atlas. Therefore, to further remove site effects, we applied {ComBat}, a harmonization technique previously shown to eliminate site effects in multi‐site diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) and cortical thickness studies. In the current work, {ComBat} successfully removed site effects identified in connectivity and network measures and increased the power to detect age associations when using optimal combinations of connectivity metrics and brain atlases. Our proposed {ComBat} harmonization approach for {fMRI}‐derived connectivity measures facilitates reliable and efficient analysis of retrospective and prospective multi‐site {fMRI} neuroimaging studies.},

	abstract = {When training predictive models from neuroimaging data, we typically have available non-imaging variables such as age and gender that affect the imaging data but which we may be uninterested in from a clinical perspective. Such variables are commonly referred to as 'confounds'. In this work, we firstly give a working definition for confound in the context of training predictive models from samples of neuroimaging data. We define a confound as a variable which affects the imaging data and has an association with the target variable in the sample that differs from that in the population-of-interest, i.e., the population over which we intend to apply the estimated predictive model. The focus of this paper is the scenario in which the confound and target variable are independent in the population-of-interest, but the training sample is biased due to a sample association between the target and confound. We then discuss standard approaches for dealing with confounds in predictive modelling such as image adjustment and including the confound as a predictor, before deriving and motivating an Instance Weighting scheme that attempts to account for confounds by focusing model training so that it is optimal for the population-of-interest. We evaluate the standard approaches and Instance Weighting in two regression problems with neuroimaging data in which we train models in the presence of confounding, and predict samples that are representative of the population-of-interest. For comparison, these models are also evaluated when there is no confounding present. In the first experiment we predict the {MMSE} score using structural {MRI} from the {ADNI} database with gender as the confound, while in the second we predict age using structural {MRI} from the {IXI} database with acquisition site as the confound. Considered over both datasets we find that none of the methods for dealing with confounding gives more accurate predictions than a baseline model which ignores confounding, although including the confound as a predictor gives models that are less accurate than the baseline model. We do find, however, that different methods appear to focus their predictions on specific subsets of the population-of-interest, and that predictive accuracy is greater when there is no confounding present. We conclude with a discussion comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and the implications of our evaluation for building predictive models that can be used in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {When collecting large amounts of neuroimaging data associated with psychiatric disorders, images must be acquired from multiple sites because of the limited capacity of a single site. However, site differences represent a barrier when acquiring multisite neuroimaging data. We utilized a traveling-subject dataset in conjunction with a multisite, multidisorder dataset to demonstrate that site differences are composed of biological sampling bias and engineering measurement bias. The effects on resting-state functional {MRI} connectivity based on pairwise correlations because of both bias types were greater than or equal to psychiatric disorder differences. Furthermore, our findings indicated that each site can sample only from a subpopulation of participants. This result suggests that it is essential to collect large amounts of neuroimaging data from as many sites as possible to appropriately estimate the distribution of the grand population. Finally, we developed a novel harmonization method that removed only the measurement bias by using a traveling-subject dataset and achieved the reduction of the measurement bias by 29\% and improvement of the signal-to-noise ratios by 40\%. Our results provide fundamental knowledge regarding site effects, which is important for future research using multisite, multidisorder resting-state functional {MRI} data.},

	abstract = {Connectome-based predictive modeling ({CPM}; Finn et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2017) was recently developed to predict individual differences in traits and behaviors, including fluid intelligence (Finn et al., 2015) and sustained attention (Rosenberg et al., 2016a), from functional brain connectivity ({FC}) measured with {fMRI}. Here, using the {CPM} framework, we compared the predictive power of three different measures of {FC} (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and two different prediction algorithms (linear and partial least square [{PLS}] regression) for attention function. Accordance and discordance are recently proposed {FC} measures that respectively track in-phase synchronization and out-of-phase anti-correlation (Meskaldji et al., 2015). We defined connectome-based models using task-based or resting-state {FC} data, and tested the effects of (1) functional connectivity measure and (2) feature-selection/prediction algorithm on individualized attention predictions. Models were internally validated in a training dataset using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and externally validated with three independent datasets. The training dataset included {fMRI} data collected while participants performed a sustained attention task and rested (N = 25; Rosenberg et al., 2016a). The validation datasets included: 1) data collected during performance of a stop-signal task and at rest (N = 83, including 19 participants who were administered methylphenidate prior to scanning; Farr et al., 2014a; Rosenberg et al., 2016b), 2) data collected during Attention Network Task performance and rest (N = 41, Rosenberg et al., in press), and 3) resting-state data and {ADHD} symptom severity from the {ADHD}-200 Consortium (N = 113; Rosenberg et al., 2016a). Models defined using all combinations of functional connectivity measure (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and prediction algorithm (linear and {PLS} regression) predicted attentional abilities, with correlations between predicted and observed measures of attention as high as 0.9 for internal validation, and 0.6 for external validation (all p's {\textless} 0.05). Models trained on task data outperformed models trained on rest data. Pearson's correlation and accordance features generally showed a small numerical advantage over discordance features, while {PLS} regression models were usually better than linear regression models. Overall, in addition to correlation features combined with linear models (Rosenberg et al., 2016a), it is useful to consider accordance features and {PLS} regression for {CPM}.},

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used in making relevant predictions and inferences on individual subjects neuroimaging scan data. Previous studies have mostly focused on categorical discrimination of patients and matched healthy controls and more recently, on prediction of individual continuous variables such as clinical scores or age. However, these studies are greatly hampered by the large number of predictor variables (voxels) and low observations (subjects) also known as the curse-of-dimensionality or small-n-large-p problem. As a result, feature reduction techniques such as feature subset selection and dimensionality reduction are used to remove redundant predictor variables and experimental noise, a process which mitigates the curse-of-dimensionality and small-n-large-p effects. Feature reduction is an essential step before training a machine learning model to avoid overfitting and therefore improving model prediction accuracy and generalization ability.

	abstract = {We develop reinforcement learning trials for discovering individualized treatment regimens for lifethreatening diseases such as cancer. A temporal-difference learning method called Q-learning is utilized that involves learning an optimal policy from a single training set of finite longitudinal patient trajectories. Approximating the Q-function with time-indexed parameters can be achieved by using support vector regression or extremely randomized trees. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the procedure can extract optimal strategies directly from clinical data without relying on the identification of any accurate mathematical models, unlike approaches based on adaptive design. We show that reinforcement learning has tremendous potential in clinical research because it can select actions that improve outcomes by taking into account delayed effects even when the relationship between actions and outcomes is not fully known. To support our claims, the methodology's practical utility is illustrated in a simulation analysis. In the immediate future, we will apply this general strategy to studying and identifying new treatments for advanced metastatic stage {IIIB}/{IV} non-small cell lung cancer, which usually includes multiple lines of chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, there is significant potential of the proposed methodology for developing personalized treatment strategies in other cancers, in cystic fibrosis, and in other life-threatening diseases.

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the combination of drugs and vitamins, and their doses, for use in a single daily pill to achieve a large effect in preventing cardiovascular disease with minimal adverse effects. The strategy was to simultaneously reduce four cardiovascular risk factors (low density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, serum homocysteine, and platelet function) regardless of pretreatment levels. Design: We quantified the efficacy and adverse effects of the proposed formulation from published meta-analyses of randomised trials and cohort studies and a meta-analysis of 15 trials of low dose (50-125 mg/day) aspirin. Outcome measures: Proportional reduction in ischaemic heart disease ({IHD}) events and strokes; life years gained; and prevalence of adverse effects. Results: The formulation which met our objectives was: a statin (for example, atorvastatin (daily dose 10 mg) or simvastatin (40 mg)); three blood pressure lowering drugs (for example, a thiazide, a β blocker, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), each at haft standard dose; folic acid (0.8 mg); and aspirin (75 mg). We estimate that the combination (which we call the Polypill) reduces {IHD} events by 88\% (95\% confidence interval 84\% to 91\%) and stroke by 80\% (71\% to 87\%). One third of people taking this pill from age 55 would benefit, gaining on average about 11 years of life free from an {IHD} event or stroke. Summing the adverse effects of the components observed in randomised trials shows that the Polypill would cause symptoms in 8-15\% of people (depending on the precise formulation). Conclusion: The Polypill strategy could largely prevent heart attacks and stroke if taken by everyone aged 55 and older and everyone with existing cardiovascular disease. It would be acceptably safe and with widespread use would have a greater impact on the prevention of disease in the Western world than any other single intervention.},

Existing works largely focus on modeling single phenotype and currently available multivariate phenotypic methods often suffer from scaling and interpretation. In this article, motivated by understanding how genetic underpinning impacts human brain variation, we develop an integrative Bayesian heritability analysis to jointly estimate heritabilities for high-dimensional neuroimaging traits. To induce sparsity and incorporate brain anatomical configuration, we impose hierarchical selection among both regional and local measurements based on brain structural network and voxel dependence. We also use a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture model to realize grouping among single nucleotide polymorphism-associated phenotypic variations, providing biological plausibility. Through extensive simulations, we show the proposed method outperforms existing ones in heritability estimation and heritable traits selection under various scenarios. We finally apply the method to two large-scale imaging genetics datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and United Kingdom Biobank and show biologically meaningful results.},

	abstract = {Human brain function undergoes complex transformations across the lifespan. We employed resting-state functional {MRI} and graph-theory approaches to systematically chart the lifespan trajectory of the topological organization of human whole-brain functional networks in 126 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. Brain networks were constructed by computing Pearson's correlations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent temporal fluctuations among 1024 parcellation units followed by graph-based network analyses. We observed that the human brain functional connectome exhibited highly preserved non-random modular and rich club organization over the entire age range studied. Further quantitative analyses revealed linear decreases in modularity and inverted-U shaped trajectories of local efficiency and rich club architecture. Regionally heterogeneous age effects were mainly located in several hubs (e.g., default network, dorsal attention regions). Finally, we observed inverse trajectories of long- and short-distance functional connections, indicating that the reorganization of connectivity concentrates and distributes the brain's functional networks. Our results demonstrate topological changes in the whole-brain functional connectome across nearly the entire human lifespan, providing insights into the neural substrates underlying individual variations in behavior and cognition. These results have important implications for disease connectomics because they provide a baseline for evaluating network impairments in age-related neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Spontaneous fluctuations are a hallmark of recordings of neural signals, emergent over time scales spanning milliseconds and tens of minutes. However, investigations of intrinsic brain organization based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have largely not taken into account the presence and potential of temporal variability, as most current approaches to examine functional connectivity ({FC}) implicitly assume that relationships are constant throughout the length of the recording. In this work, we describe an approach to assess whole-brain {FC} dynamics based on spatial independent component analysis, sliding time window correlation, and k-means clustering of windowed correlation matrices. The method is applied to resting-state data from a large sample (n = 405) of young adults. Our analysis of {FC} variability highlights particularly flexible connections between regions in lateral parietal and cingulate cortex, and argues against a labeling scheme where such regions are treated as separate and antagonistic entities. Additionally, clustering analysis reveals unanticipated {FC} states that in part diverge strongly from stationary connectivity patterns and challenge current descriptions of interactions between large-scale networks. Temporal trends in the occurrence of different {FC} states motivate theories regarding their functional roles and relationships with vigilance/arousal. Overall, we suggest that the study of time-varying aspects of {FC} can unveil flexibility in the functional coordination between different neural systems, and that the exploitation of these dynamics in further investigations may improve our understanding of behavioral shifts and adaptive processes. © 2012 The Author.},

These networks and their various characteristics have been described and scrutinized through in vivo resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}). While the basic properties of networks are generally similar between healthy individuals, there is vast variability in the precise topography across the population. These individual differences are often lost in population studies due to population averaging which assumes topographical uniformity. We leveraged precision brain mapping methods to establish a new open-source, method-flexible set of precision functional network atlases: the Masonic Institute for the Developing Brain ({MIDB}) Precision Brain Atlas. Using participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ({ABCD}) study, single subject precision network maps were generated with two supervised network-matching procedures (template matching and non-negative matrix factorization), an overlapping template matching method for identifying integration zones, as well as an unsupervised community detection algorithm (Infomap). From these individualized maps we also generated probabilistic network maps and integration zones for two demographically-matched groups of n∼3000 each. We demonstrate high reproducibility between groups (Pearson’s r {\textgreater}0.999) and between methods (r=0.96), revealing both regions of high invariance and high variability. Compared to using parcellations based on groups averages, the {MIDB} Precision Brain Atlas allowed us to derive a set of brain regions that are largely invariant in network topography across populations, which provides more reproducible statistical maps of executive function in brain-wide associations. We also explore an example use case for probabilistic maps, highlighting their potential for use in targeted neuromodulation. The {MIDB} Precision Brain Atlas is expandable to alternative datasets and methods and is provided open-source with an online web interface to encourage the scientific community to experiment with probabilistic atlases and individual-specific topographies to more precisely relate network phenomenon to functional organization of the human brain. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Author {DF} is a founder of Nous Imaging, Inc.,.

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of large-scale functional networks on the cerebral cortex differs between individuals and is particularly variable in association networks that are responsible for higher-order cognition. However, it remains unknown how this functional topography evolves in development and supports cognition. Capitalizing on advances in machine learning and a large sample imaged with 27 min of high-quality functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data (n = 693, ages 8–23 years), we delineate how functional topography evolves during youth. We found that the functional topography of association networks is refined with age, allowing accurate prediction of unseen individuals’ brain maturity. The cortical representation of association networks predicts individual differences in executive function. Finally, variability of functional topography is associated with fundamental properties of brain organization, including evolutionary expansion, cortical myelination, and cerebral blood flow. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the plasticity and diversity of functional neuroanatomy during development and suggest advances in personalized therapeutics.},

The use of the {BCCM} allows us to circumvent issues related to small sample sizes, including overfitting and boundary estimates. Using expression of genes in breast cancer pathway, obtained from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource ({MuTHER}) project, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of {SNP}-based heritability estimates over univariate and likelihood-based methods. According to the {BCCM}, except {CHURC}1 (h2 = 0.27, credible interval = (0.2, 0.36)), all tested genes have trivial heritability estimates, thus explaining why recent progress in their {eQTL} identification has been limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Medical Image segmentation is an important image processing step. Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics. Result: First we present an overview of 20 evaluation metrics selected based on a comprehensive literature review. For fuzzy segmentation, which shows the level of membership of each voxel to multiple classes, fuzzy definitions of all metrics are provided. We present a discussion about metric properties to provide a guide for selecting evaluation metrics. Finally, we propose an efficient evaluation tool implementing the 20 selected metrics. The tool is optimized to perform efficiently in terms of speed and required memory, also if the image size is extremely large as in the case of whole body {MRI} or {CT} volume segmentation. An implementation of this tool is available as an open source project. Conclusion: We propose an efficient evaluation tool for 3D medical image segmentation using 20 evaluation metrics and provide guidelines for selecting a subset of these metrics that is suitable for the data and the segmentation task.},

	abstract = {Brain functional networks identified from {fMRI} data can provide potential biomarkers for brain disorders. Group independent component analysis ({GICA}) is popular for extracting brain functional networks from multiple subjects. In {GICA}, different strategies exist for reconstructing subject-specific networks from the group-level networks. However, it is unknown whether these strategies have different sensitivities to group differences and abilities in distinguishing patients. Among {GICA}, spatio-temporal regression ({STR}) and spatially constrained {ICA} approaches such as group information guided {ICA} ({GIG}-{ICA}) can be used to propagate components (indicating networks) to a new subject that is not included in the original subjects. In this study, based on the same a priori network maps, we reconstructed subject-specific networks using these two methods separately from resting-state {fMRI} data of 151 schizophrenia patients ({SZs}) and 163 healthy controls ({HCs}). We investigated group differences in the estimated functional networks and the functional network connectivity ({FNC}) obtained by each method. The networks were also used as features in a cross-validated support vector machine ({SVM}) for classifying {SZs} and {HCs}. We selected features using different strategies to provide a comprehensive comparison between the two methods. {GIG}-{ICA} generally showed greater sensitivity in statistical analysis and better classification performance (accuracy 76.45 ± 8.9\%, sensitivity 0.74 ± 0.11, specificity 0.79 ± 0.11) than {STR} (accuracy 67.45 ± 8.13\%, sensitivity 0.65 ± 0.11, specificity 0.71 ± 0.11). Importantly, results were also consistent when applied to an independent dataset including 82 {HCs} and 82 {SZs}. Our work suggests that the functional networks estimated by {GIG}-{ICA} are more sensitive to group differences, and {GIG}-{ICA} is promising for identifying image-derived biomarkers of brain disease.},

The {PWB} scale is a short 8-item summary survey of the person's self-perceived functioning in important areas such as relationships, self-esteem, purpose and meaning, and optimism. The scale is substantially correlated with other psychological well-being scales, but is briefer. The scale provides a single overall psychological well-being score and does not yield scores for various components of well-being. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience ({SPANE}) yields a score for positive experience and feelings (6 items), a score for negative experience and feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create an experience balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative feelings. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the frequency of feelings during the past month. A scale to measure Positive Thinking is also presented. Basic psychometric statistics are presented for the scales based on 573 college students at five universities.},

We propose a method for assigning ancestry that works in stages to refine estimates of ancestral population contributions to individual genomes. The method leverages genotype data in the public domain obtained from individuals with known ancestries.

Using functional {MRI} and applying independent component analysis followed by deconvolution of hemodynamic responses, we studied error preceding brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis. We found a set of brain regions in which the temporal evolution of activation predicted performance errors. These maladaptive brain activity changes started to evolve ≈30 sec before the error. In particular, a coincident decrease of deactivation in default mode regions of the brain, together with a decline of activation in regions associated with maintaining task effort, raised the probability of future errors. Our findings provide insights into the brain network dynamics preceding human performance errors and suggest that monitoring of the identified precursor states may help in avoiding human errors in critical real-world situations. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

	url = {http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm2},
	abstract = {Multivariate analysis methods such as independent component analysis ({ICA}) have been applied to the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data to study the brain function. The selection of the proper number of signals of interest is an important step in the analysis to reduce the risk of over/underfitting. The inherent sample dependence in the spatial or temporal dimension of the {fMRI} data violates the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples and limits the usefulness of the practical formulations of information-theoretic order selection criteria. We propose a novel method using an entropy rate matching principle to mitigate the effects of such sample dependence in order selection. We perform order selection experiments on the simulated {fMRI} data and show that the incorporation of the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the order selection by different criteria. We also use the proposed method to estimate the number of latent sources in {fMRI} data acquired from multiple subjects performing a visuomotor paradigm. We show that the proposed method improves the order selection by alleviating the over-estimation due to the intrinsic smoothness and the effect of smooth preprocessing on the {fMRI} data.},

	abstract = {Multidisciplinary approaches have demonstrated that the brain is potentially modulated by the long-term acquisition and practice of specific skills. Chess playing can be considered a paradigm for shaping brain function, with complex interactions among brain networks possibly enhancing cognitive processing. Dynamic network analysis based on resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) can be useful to explore the effect of chess playing on whole-brain fluidity/dynamism (the chronnectome). Dynamic connectivity parameters of 18 professional chess players and 20 beginner chess players were evaluated applying spatial independent component analysis ({sICA}), sliding-time window correlation, and meta-state approaches to rs-{fMRI} data. Four indexes of meta-state dynamic fluidity were studied: i) the number of distinct meta-states a subject pass through, ii) the number of switches from one meta-state to another, iii) the span of the realized meta-states (the largest distance between two meta-states that subjects occupied), and iv) the total distance travelled in the state space. Professional chess players exhibited an increased dynamic fluidity, expressed as a higher number of occupied meta-states (meta-state numbers, 75.8 ± 7.9 vs 68.8 ± 12.0, p = 0.043 {FDR}-corrected) and changes from one meta-state to another (meta-state changes, 77.1 ± 7.3 vs 71.2 ± 11.0, p = 0.043 {FDR}-corrected) than beginner chess players. Furthermore, professional chess players exhibited an increased dynamic range, with increased traveling between successive meta-states (meta-state total distance, 131.7 ± 17.8 vs 108.7 ± 19.7, p = 0.0004 {FDR}-corrected). Chess playing may induce changes in brain activity through the modulation of the chronnectome. Future studies are warranted to evaluate if these potential effects lead to enhanced cognitive processing and if “gaming” might be used as a treatment in clinical practice.},

	doi = {10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0019857},
	abstract = {Background: There has been widespread interest in the potential of combination cardiovascular medications containing aspirin and agents to lower blood pressure and cholesterol ('polypills') to reduce cardiovascular disease. However, no reliable placebo-controlled data are available on both efficacy and tolerability. Methods: We conducted a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a polypill (containing aspirin 75 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and simvastatin 20 mg) in 378 individuals without an indication for any component of the polypill, but who had an estimated 5-year cardiovascular disease risk over 7.5\%. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure ({SBP}), {LDL}-cholesterol and tolerability (proportion discontinued randomised therapy) at 12 weeks follow-up. Findings: At baseline, mean {BP} was 134/81 {mmHg} and mean {LDL}-cholesterol was 3.7 mmol/L. Over 12 weeks, polypill treatment reduced {SBP} by 9.9 (95\% {CI}: 7.7 to 12.1) {mmHg} and {LDL}-cholesterol by 0.8 (95\% {CI} 0.6 to 0.9) mmol/L. The discontinuation rates in the polypill group compared to placebo were 23\% vs 18\% ({RR} 1.33, 95\% {CI} 0.89 to 2.00, p = 0.2). There was an excess of side effects known to the component medicines (58\% vs 42\%, p = 0.001), which was mostly apparent within a few weeks, and usually did not warrant cessation of trial treatment. Conclusions: This polypill achieved sizeable reductions in {SBP} and {LDL}-cholesterol but caused side effects in about 1 in 6 people. The halving in predicted cardiovascular risk is moderately lower than previous estimates and the side effect rate is moderately higher. Nonetheless, substantial net benefits would be expected among patients at high risk. Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry {ACTRN}12607000099426.},

The p-values associated with these tests are exactly uniform under the null distribution, in finite samples, yielding exact Type I error control.

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“{ADEMP}”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.

To push our understanding of functional brain organization to the level of individual humans, we assembled a novel {MRI} dataset containing 5 hr of {RSFC} data, 6 hr of task {fMRI}, multiple structural {MRIs}, and neuropsychological tests from each of ten adults. Using these data, we generated ten high-fidelity, individual-specific functional connectomes. This individual-connectome approach revealed several new types of spatial and organizational variability in brain networks, including unique network features and topologies that corresponded with structural and task-derived brain features. We are releasing this highly sampled, individual-focused dataset as a resource for neuroscientists, and we propose precision individual connectomics as a model for future work examining the organization of healthy and diseased individual human brains.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.11.008},
	abstract = {Group independent component analysis ({ICA}) has been widely applied to studies of multi-subject {fMRI} data for computing subject specific independent components with correspondence across subjects. However, the independence of subject specific independent components ({ICs}) derived from group {ICA} has not been explicitly optimized in existing group {ICA} methods. In order to preserve independence of {ICs} at the subject level and simultaneously establish correspondence of {ICs} across subjects, we present a new framework for obtaining subject specific {ICs}, which we coined group-information guided {ICA} ({GIG}-{ICA}). In this framework, group information captured by standard {ICA} on the group level is exploited as guidance to compute individual subject specific {ICs} using a multi-objective optimization strategy. Specifically, we propose a framework with two stages: at first, group {ICs} ({GICs}) are obtained using standard group {ICA} tools, and then the {GICs} are used as references in a new one-unit {ICA} with spatial reference ({ICA}-R) using a multi-objective optimization solver. Comparison experiments with back-reconstruction ({GICA}1 and {GICA}3) and dual regression on simulated and real {fMRI} data have demonstrated that {GIG}-{ICA} is able to obtain subject specific {ICs} with stronger independence and better spatial correspondence across different subjects in addition to higher spatial and temporal accuracy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Spatial group independent component analysis ({GICA}) methods decompose multiple-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data into a linear mixture of spatially independent components ({ICs}), some of which are subsequently characterized as brain functional networks. Group information guided independent component analysis ({GIG}-{ICA}) as a variant of {GICA} has been proposed to improve the accuracy of the subject-specific {ICs} estimation by optimizing their independence. Independent vector analysis ({IVA}) is another method which optimizes the independence among each subject's components and the dependence among corresponding components of different subjects. Both methods are promising in neuroimaging study and showed a better performance than the traditional {GICA}. However, the difference between {IVA} and {GIG}-{ICA} has not been well studied. A detailed comparison between them is demanded to provide guidance for functional network analyses. In this work, we employed multiple simulations to evaluate the performances of the two approaches in estimating subject-specific components and time courses under conditions of different data quality and quantity, varied number of sources generated and inaccurate number of components used in computation, as well as the presence of spatially subject-unique sources. We also compared the two methods using healthy subjects' test-retest resting-state {fMRI} data in terms of spatial functional networks and functional network connectivity ({FNC}). Results from simulations support that {GIG}-{ICA} showed better recovery accuracy of both components and time courses than {IVA} for those subject-common sources, and {IVA} outperformed {GIG}-{ICA} in component and time course estimation for the subject-unique sources. Results from real {fMRI} data suggest that {GIG}-{ICA} resulted in more reliable spatial functional networks and yielded higher and more robust modularity property of {FNC}, compared to {IVA}. Taken together, {GIG}-{ICA} is appropriate for estimating networks which are consistent across subjects, while {IVA} is able to estimate networks with great inter-subject variability or subject-unique property.},

After the turn of the century the discov-eries of pervasive pleiotropy and linkage of Mendelian factors revealed the under-lying genetic mechanisms. Existing theory on the dynamics of correlated characters has been developed in the limited frame-work of practical plant and animal breed-ing. Methods of multivariate analysis, functional analysis and optimality criteria popular among evolutionists, do not ac-count for dynamical constraints imposed by the pattern of genetic variation within populations. Consideration of phenotypic variation often does not suggest any clear mecha-nism connecting growth patterns or adult variation to interspecific evolution. When there is individual variation in develop-ment,no necessary correspondence exists between ontogenetic and adult variation in a population (Cock, 1966, pp. 148-151). It is also common for the pattern of adult variation within a species to differ from that at higher taxonomic levels (Simpson, 1953, pp. 25-29). An example which will be investigated here is the brain weight:body weight relationship. At var-ious taxonomic levels, brain and body weights tend to follow the allometric equation brain = k(body)},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder ({MDD}) is a common and serious mental disorder characterized by a persistent negative feeling and tremendous sadness. In recent decades, several studies used functional network connectivity ({FNC}), estimated from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), to investigate the biological signature of {MDD}. However, the majority of them have ignored the temporal change of brain interaction by focusing on static {FNC} ({sFNC}). Dynamic functional network connectivity ({dFNC}) that explores temporal patterns of functional connectivity ({FC}) might provide additional information to its static counterpart. In the current study, by applying k-means clustering on {dFNC} of {MDD} and healthy subjects ({HCs}), we estimated 5 different states. Next, we use the hidden Markov model as a potential biomarker to differentiate the {dFNC} pattern of {MDD} patients from {HCs}. Comparing {MDD} and {HC} subjects' hidden Markov model ({HMM}) features, we have highlighted the role of transition probabilities between states as potential biomarkers and identified that transition probability from a lightly- connected state to highly connected one reduces as symptom severity increases in {MDD} subjects.Index Terms - Major depressive disorder, Dynamic functional network connectivity, Machine learning, Resting- state functional magnetic resonance imaging, Hidden Markov model.},

	abstract = {Attention is a central component of cognitive and behavioral processes and plays a key role in basic and higher-level functioning. Posner's model of attention describes three components or networks of attention: the alerting, which involves high intensity states of arousal; the orienting, which involves the selective direction of attention; and the executive control, which involves cognitive functions such as conflict resolution and working memory. The Attention Network Test ({ANT}) is a computerized testing measure that was developed to measure these three networks of attention. This project describes the {ANT}, its widely used variants, and the recently developed {ANT} Database, a repository of data extracted from all studies that have used the {ANT} as of 2019. To illustrate the potential uses of the database, two meta-analyses conducted using the {ANT} Database are described. One explores task performance in children with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}). The other one explores regional differences between studies conducted in China, Europe, and the United States. We are currently in the process of integrating the database into a publicly available web interface. When that work is complete, researchers, clinicians, and the general public will be able to use the database to explore topics of interest related to attention.},

We introduce the population value decomposition ({PVD}), a general method for simultaneous dimensionality reduction of large populations of massive images. We show how {PVD} can be seamlessly incorporated into statistical modeling, leading to a new, transparent, and rapid inferential framework.

	abstract = {Independent component analysis ({ICA}) is a promising analysis method that is being increasingly applied to {fMRI} data. A principal advantage of this approach is its applicability to cognitive paradigms for which detailed models of brain activity are not available. Independent component analysis has been successfully utilized to analyze single-subject {fMRI} data sets, and an extension of this work would be to provide for group inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics), {ICA} does not naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences about groups of subjects. We introduce a novel approach for drawing group inferences using {ICA} of {fMRI} data, and present its application to a simple visual paradigm that alternately stimulates the left or right visual field. Our group {ICA} analysis revealed task-related components in left and right visual cortex, a transiently task-related component in bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, and a non-task-related component in bilateral visual association cortex. We address issues involved in the use of {ICA} as an {fMRI} analysis method such as: (1) How many components should be calculated? (2) How are these components to be combined across subjects? (3) How should the final results be thresholded and/or presented? We show that the methodology we present provides answers to these questions and lay out a process for making group inferences from {fMRI} data using independent component analysis. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter ({GM}) density, volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. {GWAS}, using {PLINK}, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and 733 of 818 participants (175 {AD}, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, {MCI}, and 204 healthy controls, {HC}). Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the {GWAS} results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p{\textless}10-7 and p{\textless}10-6). As expected, {SNPs} in the {APOE} and {TOMM}40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top {SNPs} were proximal to the {EPHA}4, {TP}63 and {NXPH}1 genes.

Interaction analysis indicated that {AD} patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal {GM} density loss. {NXPH}1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity, the loss of which is a hallmark of {AD}.

The proportion of height variation explained by shared environmental factors was greatest in early childhood, but these effects remained present until early adulthood. Accordingly, the relative genetic contribution increased with age and was greatest in adolescence (up to 0.83 in boys and 0.76 in girls). Comparing geographic-cultural regions (Europe, North-America and Australia and East-Asia), genetic variance was greatest in North-America and Australia and lowest in East-Asia, but the relative proportion of genetic variation was roughly similar across these regions.

The amygdala seems to be a crucial structure for fear and anxiety, and has consistently been found to be activated in anxiety-provoking situations. Apart from the amygdala, the insula and anterior cinguiate cortex seem to be critical, and all three have been referred to as the “fear network.” In the present article, we review the main findings from three major lines of research. First, we examine human models of anxiety disorders, including fear conditioning studies and investigations of experimentally induced panic attacks. Then we turn to research in patients with anxiety disorders and take a dose look at post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, we review neuroimaging studies investigating neural correlates of successful treatment of anxiety, focusing on exposure-based therapy and several pharmacological treatment options, as well as combinations of both.},

{METHODS}: A systematic research was conducted for volumetric magnetic resonance imaging studies of patients with major depressive disorder in relation to healthy control subjects. Studies had to report sufficient data for computation of effect sizes. For each study, the Cohen's d was calculated. All analyses were performed using the random effects model. Additionally, meta-regression analyses were done to explore the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity.
{RESULTS}: Patients showed large volume reductions in frontal regions, especially in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex with smaller reductions in the prefrontal cortex. The hippocampus, the putamen and caudate nucleus showed moderate volume reductions.

The study is examining approximately 11,875 youth from 21 sites from age 9 to 10 for approximately ten years into young adulthood. The {ABCD} Study® has completed recruitment for the baseline sample generally using a multi-stage probability sample including a stratified random sample of schools. The dataset has a wealth of measured attributes of youths and their environment, including neuroimaging, cognitive, biospecimen, behavioral, youth self-report and parent self-report metrics, and environmental measures. The initial goal of the {ABCD} Study was to examine risk and resiliency factors associated with the development of substance use, but the project has expanded far beyond this initial set of questions and will also greatly inform our understanding of the contributions of biospecimens (e.g., pubertal hormones), neural alterations, and environmental factors to the development of both healthy behavior and brain function as well as risk for poor mental and physical outcomes. This review outlines how the {ABCD} Study was designed to elucidate factors associated with the development of negative mental and physical health outcomes and will provide a selective overview of results emerging from the {ABCD} Study. Such emerging data includes initial validation of new instruments, important new information about the prevalence and correlates of mental health challenges in middle childhood, and promising data regarding neural correlates of both healthy and disordered behavior. In addition, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities to understanding both healthy development and the emergence of risk from {ABCD} Study data. Finally, we will overview the future directions of this large undertaking and the ways in which it will shape our understanding of the development of risk for poor mental and physical health outcomes.},

Non-suicidal self-injury ({NSSI}) is a common mental health threat among adolescents. This review aims to present the current literature on epidemiology, etiology, and therapeutic approaches with a focus on the period of adolescence.

Recent Findings
{NSSI} is widespread among adolescents both in community as well as in clinical settings with lifetime prevalence rates between 17 and 60\% in recent studies. It is influenced by multiple factors including social contagion, interpersonal stressors, neurobiological background, as well as emotional dysregulation and adverse experiences in childhood.

Summary
There is still a lack of studies regarding the psychotherapeutic as well as the psychopharmacological treatment of {NSSI} in adolescence. Furthermore, sufficient evidence for prevention programs is missing.},

Given the phenotypic similarity between major depressive disorder ({MDD}) and the less severe minor depressive disorder ({MiDD}), we hypothesised that broadening the case definition to include {MiDD} may be an efficient approach to increase sample sizes in {GWA} studies of depression. By analysing two large twin pair cohorts, we show that minor depression and major depression lie on a single genetic continuum, with major depression being more severe but not aetiologically distinct from minor depression. Furthermore, we estimate heritabilities of 37\% for minor depression, 46\% for major depression and 48\% for minor or major depression in a cohort of older adults (aged 50–92). However, the heritability of minor or major depression was estimated at 40\% in a cohort of younger adults (aged 23–38). Moreover, two robust major depression-risk {SNPs} nominally associated with major depression in our Australian {GWA} data set produced more significant evidence for association with minor or major depression. Hence, broadening the case phenotype in {GWA} studies to include subthreshold definitions, such as {MiDD}, should facilitate the identification of additional genetic risk loci for depression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Twin studies have provided evidence that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to schizophrenia ({SZ}) risk. Heritability estimates of {SZ} in twin samples have varied methodologically. This study provides updated heritability estimates based on nationwide twin data and an improved statistical methodology.
{METHODS}: Combining two nationwide registers, the Danish Twin Register and the Danish Psychiatric Research Register, we identified a sample of twins born between 1951 and 2000 (N = 31,524 twin pairs). Twins were followed until June 1, 2011. Liability threshold models adjusting for censoring with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate probandwise concordance rates and heritability of the diagnoses of {SZ} and {SZ} spectrum disorders.
{RESULTS}: The probandwise concordance rate of {SZ} is 33\% in monozygotic twins and 7\% in dizygotic twins. We estimated the heritability of {SZ} to be 79\%. When expanding illness outcome to include {SZ} spectrum disorders, the heritability estimate was almost similar (73\%).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The key strength of this study is the application of a novel statistical method accounting for censoring in the follow-up period to a nationwide twin sample. The estimated 79\% heritability of {SZ} is congruent with previous reports and indicates a substantial genetic risk. The high genetic risk also applies to a broader phenotype of {SZ} spectrum disorders. The low concordance rate of 33\% in monozygotic twins demonstrates that illness vulnerability is not solely indicated by genetic factors.},

	abstract = {Background:
Neuroimaging measures and chemical biomarkers may be important indices of clinical progression in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) and need to be evaluated longitudinally.

Objective:
To characterize cross-sectionally and longitudinally clinical measures in normal controls, subjects with {MCI}, and subjects with mild Alzheimer disease ({AD}) to enable the assessment of the utility of neuroimaging and chemical biomarker measures.

Methods:
A total of 819 subjects (229 cognitively normal, 398 with {MCI}, and 192 with {AD}) were enrolled at baseline and followed for 12 months using standard cognitive and functional measures typical of clinical trials.

Results:
The subjects with {MCI} were more memory impaired than the cognitively normal subjects but not as impaired as the subjects with {AD}. Nonmemory cognitive measures were only minimally impaired in the subjects with {MCI}. The subjects with {MCI} progressed to dementia in 12 months at a rate of 16.5\% per year. Approximately 50\% of the subjects with {MCI} were on antidementia therapies. There was minimal movement on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale for the normal control subjects, slight movement for the subjects with {MCI} of 1.1, and a modest change for the subjects with {AD} of 4.3. Baseline {CSF} measures of Aβ-42 separated the 3 groups as expected and successfully predicted the 12-month change in cognitive measures.

Conclusion:
The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative has successfully recruited cohorts of cognitively normal subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}), and subjects with Alzheimer disease with anticipated baseline characteristics. The 12-month progression rate of {MCI} was as predicted, and the {CSF} measures heralded progression of clinical measures over 12 months.

We reexamine the assumptions of existing {MR} methods and show how they need to be clarified to allow for pervasive horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneous effect sizes. We propose a comprehensive framework {GRAPPLE} to analyze the causal effect of target risk factors with heterogeneous genetic instruments and identify possible pleiotropic patterns from data. By using {GWAS} summary statistics, {GRAPPLE} can efficiently use both strong and weak genetic instruments, detect the existence of multiple pleiotropic pathways, determine the causal direction and perform multivariable {MR} to adjust for confounding risk factors. With {GRAPPLE}, we analyze the effect of blood lipids, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure on 25 disease outcomes, gaining new information on their causal relationships and potential pleiotropic pathways involved.},

	abstract = {{MRI} diffusion data suffers from significant inter- and intra-site variability, which hinders multi-site and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. This variability may arise from a range of factors, such as hardware, reconstruction algorithms and acquisition settings. To allow a reliable comparison and joint analysis of diffusion data across sites and over time, there is a clear need for robust data harmonization methods. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of diffusion data harmonization concepts and methods, and their limitations. Overall, the methods for the harmonization of multi-site diffusion images can be categorized in two main groups: diffusion parametric map harmonization ({DPMH}) and diffusion weighted image harmonization ({DWIH}). Whereas {DPMH} harmonizes the diffusion parametric maps (e.g., {FA}, {MD}, and {MK}), {DWIH} harmonizes the diffusion-weighted images. Defining a gold standard harmonization technique for {dMRI} data is still an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, in this paper we provide two classification tools, namely a feature table and a flowchart, which aim to guide the readers in selecting an appropriate harmonization method for their study.},

First introduced by Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher nearly a century ago, it is key to the response to selection in evolutionary biology and agriculture, and to the prediction of disease risk in medicine.Heritability is not necessarily constant in a population. Changes in the method of measurement, environmental change and the effects of migration, selection and inbreeding all can alter heritability.The use of high-density genetic marker technologies allows novel estimation methods of heritability, for example, estimation in unpedigreed populations and estimation within families — free of assumptions about variation between families.The estimation of heritability for new phenotypes — those that can be measured with recently developed technologies — provides knowledge about the nature of between-individual differences in core biological processes. For example, amounts of gene expression, brain scanning measurements, the length of telomeres and biochemical compounds measured by mass spectrometry show substantial heritability.Heritabilities are often surprisingly large and at present there is no consensus theory to explain why heritabilities have the values they do. Fortunately, the incredible pace of gene–phenotype discoveries in many species will allow new insights to these questions in the near future.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions1–3 (for example, task functional {MRI} ({fMRI})). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from {MRI}. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies ({BWAS})). Such {BWAS} have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify {BWAS} effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. {BWAS} associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust {BWAS} effects were detected for functional {MRI} (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread {BWAS} replication failures. In contrast to non-{BWAS} approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), {BWAS} reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

	abstract = {For most complex traits, {DNA}-based heritability (‘{SNP} heritability’) is roughly half that of twin-based heritability. A previous report from the Twins Early Development Study suggested that this heritability gap is much greater for childhood behaviour problems than for other domains. If true, this finding is important because {SNP} heritability, not twin heritability, is the ceiling for genome-wide association studies. With twice the sample size as the previous report, we estimated {SNP} heritabilities (N up to 4653 unrelated individuals) and compared them with twin heritabilities from the same sample (N up to 4724 twin pairs) for diverse domains of childhood behaviour problems as rated by parents, teachers, and children themselves at ages 12 and 16. For 37 behaviour problem measures, the average twin heritability was 0.52, whereas the average {SNP} heritability was just 0.06. In contrast, results for cognitive and anthropometric traits were more typical (average twin and {SNP} heritabilities were 0.58 and 0.28, respectively). Future research should continue to investigate the reasons why {SNP} heritabilities for childhood behaviour problems are so low compared with twin estimates, and find ways to maximise {SNP} heritability for genome-wide association studies.},

	doi = {10.1375/twin.13.4.370},
	abstract = {We assessed the heritability of head circumference, an approximation of brain size, in twin-sib families of different ages. Data from the youngest participants were collected a few weeks after birth and from the oldest participants around age 50 years. In nearly all age groups the largest part of the variation in head circumference was explained by genetic differences. Heritability estimates were 90\% in young infants (4 to 5 months), 85-88\% in early childhood, 83-87\% in adolescence, 75\% in young and mid adulthood. In infants younger than 3 months, heritability was very low or absent. Quantitative sex differences in heritability were observed in 15- and 18-year-olds, but there was no evidence for qualitative sex differences, that is, the same genes were expressed in both males and females. Longitudinal analysis of the data between 5, 7, and 18 years of age showed high genetic stability (.78 {\textgreater} R(G) {\textgreater} .98). These results indicate that head circumference is a highly heritable biometric trait and a valid target for future {GWA} studies.},
